<p class="p2 center">OF THE RELIGION OF THE SA DIKÍAHS.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">These sectaries are followers of <span class="person">Musaylima</span>. The
people of <span class="title">Islam</span>, “the true faith,” qualify <span class="person">Musaylima</span>
<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pageno">2</span>
as “the Liar.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>
These sectaries call themselves
also <dfn>Rahmáníah</dfn>; as they gave to Musaylima the
title of <span class="title">Rihm</span>, “commiserator;” they assert, that the
words: <cite>Bismilla hírrehma nirrehím</cite>, “in the name of
the bountiful and merciful God,” relate to him,
that is: a God is the merciful Musaylima. Muhammed
Kulí, the man so named, contracted friendship
with the author of this work in the year of the Hejira
1053 (A. D. 1643) at the holy sepulchre.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>
After
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pageno">3</span>
some friendly intercourse, he said: “To a true believer,
it is necessary to acknowledge Musaylima as
the bringer of the true intelligence and a prophet;
and if one does not so, his faith is not the true.”
For a confirmation of this assertion, he adduced as
evidence some verses of the Koran, and said: “Musaylima
was in the divine mission a partner of the
dignity of the prophetic asylum, Muhammed, in
the same manner as Harun was with Moses.”
He further maintained: “Two prophets are required
as being witnesses, and evidence wants two persons,
and if there be more, so much the better.”
He then highly extolled his virtues and miracles,
such as his calling the moon until she came down
and before the eyes of his companions sat down on
his lap;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span>
as his going to dry trees, and praying so,
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>
that they all became green; as having, when a newborn
child, given testimony of his prophetic gift, so
that a class of noble persons professed their faith in
his divine mission. That man besides said, that the
Koran is Muhammed’s miracle, by which he bound
the tongue of emulation to all the eloquent men of
Arabia; and in like manner the Almighty God sent to
Musaylima a book, which they call the first <dfn>Fárúk</dfn>,
“separator;” this also became a binder of tongues
to the eloquent; and no man, except Muhammed
and Musaylima, is capable of understanding these two
books, the reading of which affords salvation in this
and in the other world; but to expound them is a
great crime. The Almighty God bestowed upon
Musaylima the favor of another necessary and venerable
book, entitled “the second Fárúk” to the commands
of which it is indispensable to conform our
actions. What Muhammed had revealed is all
truth, and Musaylima, too, chose his way in that
direction; if some precepts of the latter and his
celestial book are contrary to the statements of Muhammed,
it is because Musaylima survived Muhammed<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>
(upon whom be peace!), and cancelled some
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pageno">5</span>
of them by the command of God, as in like manner,
during Mohammed’s life, some of his precepts have
been obliterated. The man quoted from the heavenly
book of Musaylima the following words:
“Adopt the belief (O men!) that our God is the God
of the world, and know, that he is the Creator of
the universe and of its inhabitants; that he is
above the creatures, none of whom is like him;
say not, that he has no body; for it may be that
he has a body, although not one like a body of his
creatures: hand, eye, and ear of God are mentioned
in the Furkán<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span>
which came from Muhammed;
and what is stated in the first Fárúk, which
is the book of Musaylima, is all truth; but the
hand, the eye, and the ear of God are not like the
hand and foot, and eye and ear of the creatures.
Thus faith is required for an intercourse with God,
and contemplation of the Creator; yet, whatever
was found existing can be seen, but the vision of
the eye, and the want of it, ought not to be taken
in a confined sense, as faith is to be entertained
that God shows himself to his servants in whatever
manner he wills.” The man further proceeded
to say: “Avoid discussions about antiquity, tradition,
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
and duration, and the evanescence or destruction
of the world, because the world is the
creation of God, and as to the last judgment and
resurrection after death, attach your faith to them,
and be confident that you shall be raised to life,
and in that fix your thoughts, that it will be with
the same or another body, in this or in another
house, to heaven or to hell, to beatitude and repose,
to recompense or punishment; attach your
faith to this, and avoid diving too deep into it,
whether it will be in this or in another habitation;
believe in the angels of God, but say not that they
have wings and feathers, or that, although this
form be not essential to them, they nevertheless
show themselves in this form, and know that good
and bad, fine and ugly, are existing; but do not
say, that this is good and that bad; for that which
you call bad may be good, and inversely: but
whatever is commanded, that do.” The man
proceeded to say: “In the time of Muhammed no
Kiblah was fixed: men turned their faces sometimes
towards Jerusalem, sometimes towards the
Kâbah of <span class="place">Mecca</span>, and sometimes towards any
other place. After Muhammed, his companions
established by force that Kâbah should be the
Kiblah. After Muhammed it was ordered by Musaylima,
that turning the face towards the great
altar, or any determined object, is impiety, and a
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pageno">7</span>
sign of infidelity, because as no figure of whatever
likeness from among living beings ought to be
made a Kiblah, why should it be permitted to
make a Kiblah of a house? Further, at the time
of prayer, one may turn his face to whatever side
he chooses, provided it be with this intention:
I address myself to thee, who hath neither side nor
figure.” At the three daily prayers which Musaylima
has prescribed, the worshipper turns his face to
no particular side; so if he turned himself at midday-prayer
to the east, before sunset he prays towards
the west; never towards a fixed place, nor to a fixed
house, because this is infidelity. These sectaries
do not call the Kâbah “the house of God,” as the
Almighty God has no house, otherwise he would
have a body. They do not use the prayers of the
Sunnites, as prayer with them is that which God
has prescribed, and not that which the prophet
likes. When they feel a desire to worship God,
they read the divine words, and then reassume their
work; but in their prayer, they never pronounce
the name of the prophet; because it is contrary to
sound doctrine to mix the veneration of a creature
with the service of God, and in the prayer nothing
comes upon their tongue but the word of God, not
even the sayings of the prophet. Moreover, this
sect prays three times a day; for, of the five prayers
<em>ordered by Muhammed</em>, Musaylima, by God’s command,
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pageno">8</span>
dispensed with the evening and morning
prayer to <span class="person">Saháh,</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span>
<span class="person">his wife</span>, who was a prophetess,
and sent to the people as the reward of an excellent
genius: this was one of the suitable favors of
the Lord to Musaylima, who himself was a prophet,
and his mate, also a prophetess.</p>

<p>As to what is said, that God commanded Iblis to
adore Adam, and that, because he disobeyed, Iblis
was expelled from the celestial court<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
&mdash;this tale is
impious; because God does not command prostration
before another object, nor induce any body to
undue worship, as he did not create Iblis for the
purpose of throwing men into error. In the second
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pageno">9</span>
Fárúk, it is stated that Iblis does not exist; the
Almighty God gave man free choice, and the faculty
of acting well or ill: wherefore he takes account of
his good and bad conduct.</p>

<p>This sect also maintains that, for marriage, neither
witnesses nor ceremonies are required; acquiescence
and agreement of two persons in a retired place are
sufficient. Further, although in the time of Muhammed
(the blessing and peace of God be upon him!)
it was permitted to ask in marriage the daughter of
relations, such as that of a paternal or maternal
uncle, yet, after Muhammed, it was prohibited; likewise,
connexion between consanguineous individuals,
which was wont of old, became forbidden in
Muhammed’s time. By Musaylima came the command
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pageno">10</span>
of God to take to wife the daughter of one,
between whom and the suitor not the least relationship
is known. To contract marriage with more
than one woman is not legal, but if any one wishes
more, he may take another on the condition of temporary
cohabitation.</p>

<p>To purify before prayer with sand or dust, when
water cannot be had, is not right.</p>

<p>When one possesses a slave, male or female, who
is an unbeliever, this slave, adopting the true faith,
becomes free without requiring the leave of his
master.</p>

<p>Whatever animal feeds upon filth which pollutes,
this to eat is not allowable. Domestic fowls are
not to be eaten, because they are winged pigs.</p>

<p>Musaylima forbade to keep the fast of Ramezan,
but instead of this he prescribed the fast at night,
in such a manner that, from sunset to sunrise, nothing
may be eat nor drunk; and also abstinence
from sexual intercourse.</p>

<p>Moreover, he abolished circumcision, for avoiding
resemblance with the Jews. He prohibited all
intoxicating liquors, such as those produced from
the palm-tree, opium, nuts, and the like.</p>

<p>Muhammed Kulî used to read much in the second
Fárúk, the book of Musaylima, which, having collected,
he recited, and said: this doctrine came to
me from my father and my ancestors, who enjoyed
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">11</span>
the noble society of Musaylima. He said and enjoined
that, after the birth of a son, the first observance
is not to approach one’s wife; the woman and
man ought to turn their mind to God, and if one
cannot effect it, he ought at least not to see his wife
but once a day. According to the second Fárúk, it
is allowable to have intercourse with another woman,
inasmuch as it is another sort of contract.
Muhammed Kuli said: “I saw Musaylima repeatedly
in dreams, in which he disclosed what was
unknown to me, and said: When by orders of
Abu-bekr, Musaylima underwent the death of a
martyr, and other Khalifs were movers of this
event, therefore the Almighty God made them
suffer the curse of mankind; in the same manner
as he threw the Jews, on account of the murder
of Jesus, into error and perdition.</p>

<p>“The murderers of Musaylima are liars and villains,
and so are the murderers of Sáíd Al Shahái
Hamzah.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 footnote"> <a name="footnote_1" id="footnote_1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_1"><span class="muchsmaller">[1]</span></a>
 In the before quoted Memoir of H. T. Colebrooke (<cite><abbr title="Asiatic Researches">As. Res.</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="volume Seven page">vol. VII
p.</abbr> 342), we read, as taken from the account of Núrukah of Shúster, what
follows: “The <span class="title">Sadikíyahs</span> are a tribe of the faithful in Hindustan;
pious men, and disciples of <span class="person">Sayyad Cabíru ’ddin</span>, who derived his
descent from Ismâil, son of Imám Jáfer. This tribe is denominated
<span class="title">Sadikíyahs</span>, by reason of the ‘sincere’ (sádik) call of that Sayyad.
Although that appellation have, according to received notions, a
seeming relation to Abú bekr, whose partisans give him this title; yet
it is probable that the sect assumed that appellation for the sake of
concealment. However no advantage ever accrues to them from it:
on the contrary, the arrogant inhabitants of <span class="place">Hind</span>, who are <dfn>Hinduis</dfn>,
being retainers of the son of the impious <span class="person">Hind</span> (meaning Hinda, the
mother of Mâviyeh), have discovered their attachment to the sect of
Shiahs, and have revived against them the calumnies which, five hundred
years before, they broached against the Ismâilahs. They maliciously
charge them with impiety. Such is indeed their ancient practice.…&mdash;In short, nearly thirty thousand persons of this
sect are settled in provinces of Hindustan, such as Multan, Lahóre,
Délhi, and Gujrát. Most of them subsist by commerce; they pay the
fifth part of their gains to the descendants of <span class="person">Sayyad Cabír</span>, who are
their priests: and both preceptor and pupil, priest and layman, all are
zealous Shiáhs.…”</p>

<p class="footnote">It will be evident that the author of the Dabistán speaks of a sect

 Musaylima once professed the creed of Muhammed, before whom he
appeared as one of the deputies sent by the tribe Henaifa, when they
offered their submission to the prophet. But in A. D., 631 Musaylima
declared himself a prophet in the country of Yamáma, and gained a
great number of followers; he dared even offer himself in a letter to Muhammed,
as a partner of his prophetic mission, but received a refusal,
with this address: “From Muhammed, the Apostle of God, to Musaylima,
the Liar.”</p>

 مشهد, <dfn>Mashhad</dfn>, signifies properly any place where a martyr has
been buried, and is particularly applied to the burying places of Imáms,
such as that of Kerbela, near Kufa, before mentioned. But the town of
Tús, in Khorassan, has almost exchanged its proper name for that of
<dfn>Mashhad</dfn>, “sepulchre,” because the Imám Risa, son of Mussa al Khadem,
was buried near that place. Is it that which is meant above? Although
the author says (<abbr title="Volume Two page">Vol. II. p.</abbr> 364), that he was in 1053 (1643) in
Lahore, which is about 1200 miles distant from Tús, his visiting, the same
year, both towns, is far from impossible. In the same year, we find him
in Kirtpúr, in the mountainous part of the Panjab (<cite>ibid.</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 416), and in
Kabul, which is on the road from Lahore to Tus.</p>

 The moon acts a conspicuous part in the prestigious exhibitions of
magicians. There appeared during the reign of Muhammed Mahadi, the
third khalif of the Abbasides, from the year of the Hejira 158 to 169
(A. D. 774-785), in the town of Nekhshab, in Khorassan, an impostor,
called <span class="person">Hakem ben Hasham</span>, whose surname was <span class="person">Sazindah mah</span>, “moon-maker.”
Having but one eye, he used to hide his deformity under a
silver veil, or mask, whence he was called <dfn>al Mokanna</dfn>, “covered by a
veil.” So concealed, he pretended nobody could bear the effulgence of
his face, like that of God himself. At the head of a numerous party, he
was not without difficulty reduced by the ruling Khalif. Hakem’s particular
mode of suicide will be adverted to in a note at the end of chapter
<abbr title="Eight">VIII</abbr>.</p>

 Muhammed died on the 8th June, A. D. 632; Musaylima did not
long survive him. He was killed, with ten thousand of his soldiers, under
the reign of Abu-bekr, in A. D. 632, in a battle against Khaled, the son
of Valid, who was sent with an army against him. Although the party
of the new prophet appeared then crushed, yet we see by the account of
the Dabistán, that its doctrine maintained itself as late as the seventeenth
century of our era.</p>

Verily, I know that which ye know not.&mdash;29. And he taught Adam the
names of all things, and then proposed them to the angels, and said:
Declare unto me the names of these things, if ye say truth.&mdash;30. They
answered: Praise be unto thee; we have no knowledge but what thou
teachest us, for thou art knowing and wise.&mdash;31. God said: O, Adam! tell
them their names. God said: Did I not tell you that I know the secrets
of heaven and earth; and know that what ye discover, and that which ye
conceal?&mdash;32. And when he said unto the angels: Worship Adam; they

thyself proudly therein; get thee hence; thou shalt be one of the contemptible.&mdash;13.

<hr class="short" />

<p>Váhed Mahmúd was born in Masjuan, a village
in the country of Gilán.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>
He was learned, active,
abstinent, austere, and eloquent; he appeared in the
year of the Hejira 600 (A. D. 1203-4).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span>
It is said
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pageno">13</span>
that when Muhammed’s body had attained a greater
perfection, from it <span class="title">Mahmúd</span> arose:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“We shall resuscitate thee in a place <dfn>Mahmúd</dfn> ‘praiseworthy.’”</p>

<p>The meaning of it is this: When in an elemental
matter, the energy conjoins in such a manner that
by it an exuberance results in the composition of the
mineral form; then it may happen that it assumes
such a superior aptness as to invest itself with a
vegetable guise; when its faculty and fitness gains a
further increase, then the animal vest adapts itself to
a suitable shape, and becomes worthy, that the
elemental matter, fitted for the dignity of a human
constitution, converges to such an excellence as to
manifest itself in the perfection of mankind. In this
manner, the parts of the human body from the
appearance of Adam were progressing in purity,
until they attained the dignity of a Muhammed, who
is the top of the ladder. In this time, as the perfection
and purity advanced, <span class="title">Mahmúd</span> appeared. On
that account it was said:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“From Muhammed is the flight to Mahmúd:</div>
  <div class="i0">As in the former there is less, and in the latter more (perfection).”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">14</span>
And the words which the lord of the prophetic
asylum, Mohammed, addressed to Alî:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I and Ali proceed from one light; thy flesh is my flesh, and thy body
is my body.”</p>

<p class="unindent">have this meaning: that the purity and energy of the
bodily parts were collected in the prophets and the
saints; and from them the bodies of Mohammed
and Ali were kneaded, in such a manner that the
chosen parts of Mohammed’s and Ali’s bodies being
conjoined and mixed together, the person of <span class="title">Mahmúd</span>
was formed.</p>

 Herbelot mentions (under the article Giogathai Khan, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 363) a <span class="person">Mahmud</span>,
surnamed <span class="person">Tarabi</span>, from his native place <span class="place">Tarab</span>, near Bokhara, as an
impostor, who by tricks and false miracles gained so many followers as to
be able to seize upon the town of Bokhara, and to make war upon the
Moghuls, in the year of the Hejira 630 (A. D. 1232). This date makes
him a contemporary with the Mahmúd of our text, in which, however,
nothing more is to be found for enabling us to identify the one with the
other. Such was the terror which the name of Mahmùd Tarabi inspired,
that the Tartars, being led against his camp, were seized by a panic, and
took to flight, in which many thousands of them were slaughtered by the
pursuing soldiers of Mahmúd, whilst he himself had been killed in his
camp, by a random shot of an arrow from the Tartarian army. But his
death remained concealed, and his friends spread the rumor of his voluntary
but temporary disappearance. His brothers, Muhammed and Ali,
were put at the head of the party, which was soon after overthrown by
the Moghuls.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section II.&mdash;An account of some of their tenets.</span>
&mdash;The author of this book heard from a person who
was one of the <dfn>safá</dfn>, “pure” Durvishes, from the
Durvish Bakáí Váhed, from the Durvish Ismâíl,
and from Mizza Takí, from Shaikh Látef illa, and
Shaikh Shaháb, who belonged to the Imaná, what
follows: Any single person is a being which longs
after earth; but other elements also exist with an
abhorrence of earth. These sectaries consider the
sun as the spirit of fire, and call it the Kâbah of
worship, the fire-temple of obedience to the holy
being. Hakím Khákani says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“O Kâbah of the traveller of heaven,</div>
  <div class="i0">O zemzem,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span>
sacred well of fire to the world.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">15</span>
They hold the heaven to be air, and the moon to
be the spirit of water. They agree upon transmigration
in the following manner: when a man dies
and is buried, the component parts of his body
manifest themselves in the shape of minerals or
vegetables, until the latter become the food of animals,
or serve as aliment to mankind. These sectaries
subjoin: in the food may reside intelligence and
action; for the dispersed ingredients of a body are
in the food; intelligence and action collect all in
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">16</span>
one place, where * they experience no dispersion,
although the conformation of the body may be disjoined;
whether in the producing of a mineral, a
vegetable, an animal, or a man. *<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span>
They do not
agree upon the existence of a rational unsubstantial
soul. They know of no heaven without the
elements, and believe the necessary original principle
to be a point of earth. Instead of <cite>Bísmilla
hirrehma nirrehím</cite>, “in the name of the bountiful
and merciful God,” they write <cite>Isteâín ba ne fseg
illazi la illah hú</cite>, “I assist myself of thy essence
which alone is God;” and instead of <cite>láysa kamsillah
shaya</cite>, “nothing is like it;” they say <cite>Ana merkeb
almabin</cite>, “I am the vehicle of him who explains the
truth.”</p>

 <span class="title">Zemzem</span> is the name of a famous well at Mecca. According to the
Muhammedans, it was formed from the source which God made appear
in favor of Ismâil and Hagar, his mother, whom Abraham drove from his
house, and obliged to retire to Arabia. When afterwards the patriarch
came to visit his banished son Ismâil, and built the square temple, called
Kâbah, he bestowed upon him the possession of it and the surrounding
country, since called Mecca. This place became an object of contest between
Ismâil’s posterity and the Arabian tribe of Jorhamides. The latter,
after having possessed themselves of it, were attacked by the former, but
before yielding it, they threw the sacred black stone, with the two gazelles
of massive gold which an Arabian king had presented to the temple, into
the well, and then completely filled it up. So it remained until the time
of an ancestor of Muhammed, called Abdal mothleb; he was admonished
by an heavenly voice to clear the well, the situation of which was at
the same time indicated to him. This was near the idols Assat and
Neilah, which were first to be removed, in spite of their adorers, the
Koráishites. The latter, having ceded the well, claimed to share the
treasure which Abdal mothleb had found in it. The new contest was to
be decided by Ebn Sáid, a famous prophet, who lived on the confines of
Syria. Upon the way to him, through a desert, when both parties were
dying of thirst, a fountain which sprung up beneath the foot of Abdal
mothleb’s camel brought about a reconciliation between them; the well
was cleared; the treasure found was consecrated to the temple, which in
after times gained so much celebrity.&mdash;(<cite>Herbelot after Khondemir.</cite>)</p>

 In the translation of this obscure passage between the two asterisks
(<abbr title="edition">edit.</abbr> of Calcutta, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 375, <abbr title="lines">l.</abbr> 17, 18) I followed the manuscript of Oude,
which reads a little differently: <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">کیب كالبد کشادہ شوپر اکندہ نکردند اکرچہ ترکیب كالبد کشادہ شود خواہ درنشاء جمادی خواہ نباتی خواہ حیوانى یا نشانی</span></p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section <abbr title="Three">III</abbr>.&mdash;Upon some of the sayings of Váhed.</span>
&mdash;The <span class="title">Mizán</span>, “balance,” is a book which Váhed
composed with many others; it is distinguished by
the word <dfn>naskh</dfn> and “treatise;” and each naskh and
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">17</span>
treatise has a particular name. In the Mízán, which
is reputed among the naskhs, it is stated, that the
materials of the world existed from the very beginning,
which signifies from the first appearance of
<dfn>afrád</dfn>, “rudimental units (monades?),” which are
primordial, that is to say, the root of the before-said
state, until the time when these rudimental units,
tempered together, became vegetables; thence rose
animals, which are called <dfn>dabtah ul ares</dfn>, “the reptiles
of the world.” Thus it existed until man was
formed. The first mentioned state might have
extended to sixteen thousand years; so that eight
thousand years of the said number may be the period
of Arabia, which is the superior, and eight thousand
years the period of Ajem (Persia), which is the inferior
period. In the sequel, when the said world,
which is the era of the first mentioned rudimental
units, had been so constituted as to admit the formation
of man; then the duration of life, comprising
the period of man, was to be also sixteen thousand
years; of which eight thousand years should revolve
for eight perfect prophets of Arabia, and other eight
thousand years for eight perfect teachers of Ajem.
Further, when the cycle of the two formations shall
be completed, then the turn of the fundamental units
is to reappear. After twice the said eight thousand,
that is, sixteen thousand years, according to simple
computation, when a perfect cycle of mankind and
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
the world, in sixty-four thousand years,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span>
on conditions
exterior and interior, manifest and hidden,
shall have been completed, then an entire period
shall have received the seal.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> On certain customs, forms of speech,
and traditions of this sect.</span>&mdash;Mahmúd has treatises
and rules conformable to the law of the prophet;
but he interpreted the Koran according to his own
creed. Of his established customs are the following:
One living in solitude is called <dfn>váhed</dfn>, “recluse.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_15" id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span>
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">19</span>
Praises are due to the man devoted to this state,
whose whole life is spent in holiness, poverty, and
retirement; who feels no inclination for connexion;
takes little, and no more than necessary, food; such
a man will rise to perfection, and become a “váhed,”
attaining the divine dignity which leads to that of a
“teacher.” If the pious person feels himself inclined
to connexion with a woman, let him enjoy
her once in his whole life; if he cannot otherwise,
once in one year; if he requires more, once in forty
days; if this be not enough, once in a month; if still
more, once in a week.</p>

<p>A váhed is reported to have given the following
information: When one descends from the state of
a man to the state of an irrational animal, or from
that to a vegetable, or from a vegetable becomes a
mineral; in this manner, by reaction of impressions
and dispositions, he receives in each state a mark
(<dfn>mahs</dfn>), which he bears from formation to formation:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Fear the intelligence of the believer, because he sees by the light
of God.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
<dfn>Mahs</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_16" id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span> in the dictionary is interpreted “a computer,”
but in the idiom of this tribe it signifies
(as just said) that every individual, in his disposition
and action, bears a vestige of the disposition of a
former state. It is a part of their persuasion, that,
when an individual enters for the first time in a
society, the name of whatever in the three kingdoms
of nature he first brings upon his tongue, is supposed
to be the <dfn>ihśa</dfn>, or “mark,” that in a former
state he had been the very thing the name of which
had fallen from his tongue.</p>

<p>These sectaries hold, that pilgrims exercise the
profession of cheats, wearing a garment marked
with stripes, which they call the vest of Kerbála;
and that they practise but hypocrisy and deceit.
When, according to their low disposition, they
descend to the state of brutes, they become animals,
which the Hindus call <dfn>Galharí</dfn>, “squirrel;” and when
transformed into vegetables, they become striped
pumpkins, or weak jujube-trees; when they undergo
the transformation into minerals, they are onyxes.
In this sense this sect interprets the <dfn>mahs</dfn>, or
“mark.” Lawyers and governors, who wash
hands and mouth, friends of white garments, become
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">21</span>
geese, which at every moment plunge their head
into water; in the state of vegetables, they assume
the form of sticks for rubbing teeth, of reading-sticks,
and of mats to cover the place of prayer;
and in the state of minerals, they figure as hard
stones, stones of sepulchres, and magnets. The
glow-worms are torch-bearers, who, descending by
degrees, came to take this shape. A dog, having
been in his former state a Turk of the tribe <span class="title">Kazelbásh</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span>
and his crooked sword having become his
tail, betrays his Turkish origin by coming forth at
the call <dfn>khach</dfn>: which in Turkish means “forth.”
These sectaries further say, that the iron by which
a prophet or a saint has been killed, is that which
acquires excellence.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Saints, when they desire the voyage to the eternal kingdom,</div>
  <div class="i0">Desire from the edge of thy blade the <dfn>takbír</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_18" id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span>
 ‘magnifying exclamation,’ of death.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>They also hold, that the Imám Hossain from state
to state descended from Moses, and that Yezíd (his
murderer) descended from Pharaoh. Moses, in
his time, drowned Pharaoh in the waters of the
Nile, and obtained the victory over him; but in the
latter state Moses, having become Hossain, and Pharaoh,
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pageno">22</span>
Yezíd, the latter did not give to Hossain the
water of the <dfn>Ferát</dfn>, “Euphrates,” but with the water
of the sharp steel, deprived his body of life.</p>

<p>These men further assert that, whatever sorts of
minerals, vegetables, and animals are black, were
formerly black-faced men, and whatever are white,
were men with a white skin.</p>

<p>These sectaries all venerate the sun, and profess
that he is the Kíblah; and the door of the Kâbah
facing the sun refers to this meaning, that the sun is
the true Kíblah; they have a prayer which they chant
with their face turned towards the sun.</p>

<p>They maintain that, when the period of Ajem
takes place, men will direct their road to God, and
they venerate these men, and hold human nature to
be divine. Their salutation is: <cite>Alla, alla</cite>. When the
period of Ajem is completed, men will remain, and
they think that the men whom we venerate were
superior in rank to those who now exist; on which
account the latter continue to form idols similar to
men, and worship them. The worship of idols will
prevail, until the period of Ajem returns, and this
will be its mode of continuance.</p>

<p>Mahmúd called himself a <span class="title">Váhed</span>, and declared
himself to be the <span class="title">Mahdy</span> promised, whose appearance
was predicted by the prophet; he said, that the
religion of Muhammed is cancelled, and that now
the true faith is that of <span class="title">Mahmúd</span>: as was said:</p>

<p>His disciples are dispersed in the four quarters
the world, and in the whole country of Iran a great
number of them resides, but they dare not make
themselves known, because the King, now the inhabitant
of heaven, Shah Abás, son of Shah
Khodábendah Sáfaví, put many of them to death.
The belief of the Mahmúdíán is, that Shah Abás,
when he had met Taráb and Kamál, who were perfect
Váhadis, and taken information from them,
wanted to publish them as his own, and on that
account killed them both. They subjoin that, although
he had great pretensions, yet he never
attained perfection; because, on account of the
world and ostentation, he had destroyed the perfect.
The author of this work heard from an Amín:
“Shah Abás was a perfect Amín, and killed whomever
he did not find well founded in this creed.
Thus, he admitted me to his society, and desired
me to remain in Iśfahán; when I did not consent
to it, he granted me the expenses of my journey to
India.” It is said, that in these times Shah Abás
came on foot to visit the place of <span class="person">Hossein’s</span> martyrdom,
<span class="place">that is, Kerhála</span>, where he said to Taráb: “I
feel pain from my foot journey.” Taráb answered:
“This is owing to the inconsistency of
thy natural intellect; for if the Imám for whose
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pageno">24</span>
sake thou hast performed the journey joined God,
why seekest thou the nether place of his martyrdom;
and if he has not joined God, what hast thou
to hope from him? Find thou a living Imám.”
The Shah asked: “Who is the living Imám?” The
saint answered: “I.” The king replied: “Well,
I shall fire a ball from a gun upon thee; if it
takes no effect, I will follow thee.” Taráb gave
this answer: “Your Imám, Rizá, died by the grain
of a grape; how shall I resist the ball of a gun?”
At last the Shah fired upon and killed him. As
Kamál openly professed the creed of Taráb, the
king associated him with the latter.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_19" id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>It is reported, that one of the Imanás came to
Hosséin Khan, of Shám, and having converted him
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pageno">25</span>
to his creed, he heard the following speech from
him: “One day, when during the Maheram they
read the history of the martyrdom <em>of Hossein</em>, and
he too (Hossein Khan) was weeping, Shah Abás
said: ‘You, why do you cry, as if it were the
<span class="title">Shámlús</span> (that is to say, the natives of Shám) who
did the action?’ The answer was: ‘We do not
cry on account of Hossein: but because from our
number also fine youths were killed.’”</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“With the same eyes with which you look on us,</div>
  <div class="i0">With the same eyes is it, that we look on you.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The <span class="title">Duníahs</span>, a particular sect, so called in the
language of the Imanahs, think slightly of Hossein.
On account of their meanness, they made no progress
in the religion of Mahmúd. Azízí, one of the
Muselmans of Shiráz, told the author of this book in
Lahore: “I once reviled Mahmúd; at night I saw
him in a dream; he approached me with a lightning-flashing
face, and said: ‘Hast thou perused
my works?’ I answered, ‘I have.’ He subjoined:
‘Why dost thou speak abusively of me?
If thou perseverest in this manner, I will chastise
thee.’”</p>

<p>It is reported by the Váhadís, that Khajah Háfiz of
Shíráz professed also this creed. As Mahmúd
dwelt a long time upon the border of the river Rúdáres,
the Khájah said:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“O zephir! when thou passest over the border of Rúdáres,</div>
  <div class="i0">Imprint kisses upon the ground of that river, and perfume the air with musk.”
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span></div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>A person called Fakher eddin, who was one of
this sect, gave the information that, according to
the report of the Duníah, Mahmud threw himself into
aqua fortis;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_20" id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span>
but this rumor is false, and proceeded
from rancor. A great number of learned and pious
persons, who were contemporaries of the founder
of this sect, or lived soon after him, followed and
professed his doctrine.</p>

 It is not clear whether above is meant a <dfn>hermit</dfn>, or a <dfn>monk</dfn> of a
distinct order. Monachism is not sanctioned by the strict rule of Islam,
but it appears to be the natural spontaneous growth of Asia. In the
first year of the Hejira (A. D. 622) forty-five citizens of Mecca associated
with forty-five inhabitants of Medina in a sort of confraternity, and
pledged themselves to community of property, and to a regular daily
performance of religious practices in a spirit of penitence and mortification:
they were called <span class="title">Sufis</span>, of whom hereafter. Abu bekr and Alí formed
and presided over similar congregations. The latter conferred the presidency
of it, under the mysterious name of <span class="title">Khiláfet</span>, upon <span class="person">Hassan Baśrí</span>
(mentioned in <abbr title="volume Two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 389, note 1). Some of their successors deviated
from the rules of this first establishment, and, in the course of time, a
multitude of monastic orders were founded, each headed by a chief called
<span class="title">Pir</span> or <span class="title">Shaikh</span>. One of the most celebrated orders was that founded in
the year of the Hejira 37 (A. D. 657) by <span class="person">Uweis Karní</span>, a native of <span class="place">Karn</span>,
in Yemen. The most distinguished in the Ottoman empire are thirty-two
in number, founded between the years of the Hejira 149 and 1164
(A. D. 776 and 1750). Three of them descend from the congregation of
Abu bekr, and the rest from that of Alí.&mdash;(See <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Tableau général de l’Empire

 Shah Abbas <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> has been already mentioned in a note (<abbr title="volume Two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 146),
where, according to sir John Malcolm’s History of Persia, the duration of
his reign is stated to have been forty-three years; his age seventy; and
the date of his death A. D. 1628; somewhat differently from Herbelot,
who makes his reign forty-five, his age sixty-three, and the date of his
death A. D. 1629. Abbas <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, called the Great, on account of his magnificent
buildings, and his skilful interior policy, was very much attached
to the religion of Ali, which was always, until our days, dominant
in Persia; his taking possession of Baghdád, Nudjef, Kerbelah,
Kásmín, and Sámerah, where the remains of Ali and his descendants are
buried, was more agreeable to the Persians than the whole of his other
conquests; dressed with the mantle of the saints of Arbeli, that is of
Sofi and Haidar, ancestors of the present Persian kings, Abbas was almost
adored by his subjects. This renders the recital above, respecting his
religious zeal, very probable. It will be remembered that this Shah sent
sir George Shirley as his ambassador to England; and that king James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
dispatched sir Drodmore Cotton on an embassy to Persia, in 1626.</p>

 This was the manner of death chosen by Mokanna, in the year of the
Hejira 563 (A. D. 776). This upstart prophet (see <a href="#footnote_4">note 1</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 3), being
pent up in a mountain-castle by the forces of the khalif Mohadi, without
hope of escape, poisoned the garrison and his family, and then plunged
into a vessel full of aqua fortis, which consumed every part of his body
except his hair; he hoped that, from his disappearance, he should be
supposed to have been taken up to heaven. One of his concubines, who
by concealment had escaped destruction, and had seen every thing, revealed
what had taken place; but many of his followers continued to
believe in his divinity and future reappearance.</p>

<p class="footnote">I shall here remark, that destroying human bodies by means of aqua
fortis is an ancient practice, mentioned in the Desátir (<abbr title="English translation page">Engl. transl., p.</abbr>
29), and accounts for the fact of so many funeral urns being found in
Asia without ashes in them.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Of the religion of the Roshenian: in three Sections.</span></p>

<p class="hanging smaller"><abbr title="Section One"><span class="sc">Sect.</span> I</abbr>.&mdash;Of the appearance of Miyan Bayezid, and some of his
sayings.</p>

<p class="hanging smaller"><abbr title="Section Two"><span class="sc">Sect.</span> II.</abbr>&mdash;Some account of his proceedings.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Section</span> <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>&mdash;Of the appearance of the lord Míyán
Báyezid.</p>

<p><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pageno">27</span>
In the Hálnámeh, a true work from Báyezid’s pen,
it is stated that the lord <span class="person">Míyán Báyezíd Ansári</span> was
the son of Shaikh <span class="person">Abdullah</span>, who descended in the
seventh generation from Shaikh <span class="person">Siráj-eddin Ansári</span>,
and that, in the latter time of the dominion of the
Afghans, he was born in the town of Jalendher in
the Panjab.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_21" id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span>
A year after this event, the blessed
lord <span class="person">Zahír-eddin Báber Pádsháh</span>, having obtained a
victory over the Afghans, conquered Hind. In the
history of the Moghúls it is recorded that, in the
year of the Hejira 932 (A. D. 1525)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_22" id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span>
the blessed lord
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pageno">28</span>
Báber Pádshah defeated <span class="person">Ibráhím Khán Afghán</span>. In
the before-said Hálnámeh is to be found that the
mother of Míyán Báyezíd was called <span class="title">Bánin</span>, and that
the father of Banín and the grandfather of Abd ullah
were brothers, and had their residence in the town
of Jalendher. Míyán Báyezíd was born in this place.
The father of Abdullah asked Banin, the daughter
of Mohammed Amin, in marriage for his son Abd ullah.
The father of Báyezíd Abd ullah resided at
Kánígaram, which is situated in Kóhistan (the hilly
country) of the Afghans.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_23" id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span>
When the conquests of
the Moghúls began to extend, Banín also came with
Báyezid to Kánígaram. Abd ullah had no liking
for Banin, on which account he repudiated her;
and Míyán Báyezíd experienced many sufferings
from the enmity of another wife of Abd ullah, and
from the son of the wife of Yâkub, besides the carelessness
of his father.</p>

<p>It was the custom of Míyán Bayezíd that, whenever
he went to tend his own field, he took care also
of the fields of others, and guarded them. From
his infancy he felt a disposition towards the first
cause, so as to investigate&mdash;“the heavens and the
earth are here; but where is God?” When
Khájah Ismâîl was blessed in a dream by a revelation,
he devoted himself to austere practices of
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">29</span>
piety, and many persons who partook in his exercises,
derived benefit from them. Báyezíd wished to
become his disciple; but Abd ullah forbade it, saying:
“It is a disgrace to me that thou shouldst be
the disciple of the meanest of our relations; go
to the sons of Shaikh <span class="person">Bahá-eddín Zakaríá</span>.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_24" id="fnanchor_24"></a><a href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span>
Báyezíd
replied: “The character of a Shaikh is no inheritance.”
Finally, Báyezíd was called by a mysterious
influence to sanctity, and passed through the
gradations of <dfn>sheríât</dfn>, “external law;” <dfn>hakíket</dfn>, “reality;”
<dfn>mârifet</dfn>, “true knowledge;” <dfn>kurbet</dfn>, “proximity;”
<dfn>vâsalet</dfn>, “union;” and <dfn>sekúnat</dfn>, “dwelling
in God.” Many men joined him, at which the
envious were vexed, and he invited to him the
crowd which had not attained the same degree.
With Báyezíd lineage obtained no respect, but only
knowledge and virtue were valued, as</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Paradise belongs to the servants of God, let them</div>
  <div class="i0">Be <dfn>habshís</dfn>, ‘negroes,’ and hell is for the depraved,</div>
  <div class="i0">Let them be <dfn>sáids</dfn> of Koresh extraction.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>He saw God manifest:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Peradventure you may see your God made manifest.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pageno">30</span>
And the order was given to Báyezíd to say:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I have seen thee by thee; I have heard thee from thee.”</p>

<p>God said to him further:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“The disgrace of this world is lighter than the disgrace</div>
  <div class="i0">Of thy future world; haste towards what is good; be slow</div>
  <div class="i0">Towards what is bad.”</div>
 </div>
</div>


<p>And the Lord God announced to him:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I have established as duties the exterior and the interior worship:
the exterior worship as a duty for acquiring knowledge, and the
interior worship as a perpetual duty.”</p>

<p>Báyezíd was perplexed: “If I offer prayers I am
an idolator, and if I neglect them I am an infidel;
for it is said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“‘The offering of prayers is idolatry, and the neglect of them
infidelity.’”</p>

<p>Then the command arrived: “Perform the prayers
of the prophet;” he asked: “What prayers
are these?” The Almighty God said: “The
praise of the Divinity.” Afterwards he chose this
prayer, as it is said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The worship of those who are attached to the unity of God is, before
men, like the worship of worshippers; but before God, it participates
in the object of worship itself.”</p>

<p>Báyezíd devoted himself so much more to secret
practices of piety, about which the prophet has said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The best remembrance of God is secret remembrance, and the best
food is that which is sufficient.”</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Remember your God morning and evening; and be not one of the
negligent.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
His friends saw in a night dream, and he himself
heard the voice, that Báyezíd should be called <span class="title">Míyán
Róshen</span>, and he obtained eternal life, according to
the words of God:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Say not of him who is slain in the way of the Lord, that he is dead,
but that he is alive; but you cannot distinguish the deaf, the dumb,
and the blind; nor can they reply to you; for they are deaf in hearing
the truth, dumb in speaking the truth, and blind in seeing the truth.”</p>

<p>He made himself free of the crowd of such description;
and frequently divine inspiration came
upon him. Now, according to the prophetic saying:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Inspiration is a light which descends into the heart, and displays the
real nature of the things according as they are.”</p>

<p>And Jabríl also descended to him; we read in the
Korán:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I send down angels and the spirit, at my pleasure, on whomsoever
I please among my servants.”</p>

<p>God Almighty elected him also for an apostle, and
conferred upon him the gift of prophecy:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I have sent none before thee, excepting those persons who have
received revelation.”</p>

<p>The lord Míyan Róshen, that is, Báyezíd, was extremely
righteous in his conduct, as it is said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“When God intends the good of one of his creatures, he gives him an
admonisher in his spirit, and a restrainer in his heart; so that, of his
own accord, he admonishes and restrains himself.”</p>

<p>Míyán Róshen, that is, Báyezíd, said to the
learned: “What says the confession of the faith?”
The reply was: “We bear testimony that there is
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">32</span>
no god but God;” that is: we testify that there is
no god worthy to be worshipped but God Almighty.
Míyán Báyezíd said: “If one is not acquainted with
Lord Almighty, and says: ‘I am acquainted with
him,’ he is a liar; as it is said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“He who sees not God, knows not God.”</p>

<p class="unindent">Móuláná Zakaríá said to Míyán Báyazíd: “Thou
sayest that thou art acquainted with the heart,
and thou proclaimest thyself the master of opening
the hearts; give me information of my heart,
and if this proves to be true, I shall then place my
confidence in thee.” Míyán Róshen Báyazíd replied:
“I am the master of opening the hearts; but
there is no heart in thee; if thou hadst possessed
a heart, I should have given thee information
about it.” Then Móulána Zikeríá declared (to
those about him): “Kill me first; if a heart comes
forth from my body, then put Báyazíd to death,
and if none appear, then let him be safe.” Míyán
Báyazid said: “The heart which thou mentionest
will come forth if a calf, a kid, or a dog be killed;
but that lump of flesh is not the heart. The
Arabian prophet says:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The heart of the faithful is more elevated than the ninth or empyrean
heaven; and more spacious than the extent of the ninth heaven (the
throne of God).”</p>

<p>“And again:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Hearts bear witness of hearts.”</p>

<p class="unindent"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>
Móulána Zakaríá said to him: “Thou takest thyself
for a master of opening the tombs; let us go
together to a burying ground, that the dead may
converse with thee.” Míyán Báyezíd replied: “If
thou didst listen to the voice of the dead, I should
not call thee an infidel.” The author of this work
observed to Míyan, who was attached to the Roshinian
persuasion: “If, instead of these words, the
lord Míyan had said: When I hear your voice,
it is the voice of the dead, and proceeds from the
tomb of the corporeal members, it would have
been better.” Being pleased with this observation,
the Míyán wrote down upon the margin of the
Hálnámeh, that this also is the speech of the lord
Míyán. The Mobed says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Between our friends we saw and we gave</div>
  <div class="i0">To the searchers of the road a mark without a mark.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Then the learned said to Míyán Báyezíd: “By
what word or deed of thine shall men believe in
thee?” Míyán Róshen Báyazíd replied: “Let
there be one of your number, the best and ablest,
who applies to science and practises devotion; let
him join me, and according to my direction perform
exercises of worship and piety; if he find a
superior advantage, then believe in me.”</p>

<p>A person named Malik Mirzá said: “O Báyezíd, beware
of arrogant speech, and call not men detestable;
whoever likes, may follow thy path, but if
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
he does not like it, let him remain away from it.”
Míyán Róshen Báyezíd answered: “I will propose
a simile: if in a house which should have but one
door, a great number of persons had fallen asleep,
and in that house fire had broken out; if by accident
one person should be awake, ought he to
awake the others, or not?” His adversaries said:
“O Báyezíd, since God Almighty has charged thee
with his orders, declare, ‘Jabriyil descended to
me, and I am the Mahdi;’ but call not the people
infidels and detestable.”</p>

<p>Míyán Róshen Bayazíd did not think it right to
eat of the flesh of an animal killed by a person whom
he did not know, and who did not adhere to the
rule of the unity of God. Báyezíd knew that:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“A <em>worldly</em> wise man, before man, is living, but before God, dead;
his form is like the form of a man, but his qualities like the qualities
of beasts; whilst a man, knowing God, is living before God; his form is
like the form of a man, and his qualities are like the qualities of the
merciful God.”</p>

<p>Báyezíd said to his father Abd ullah: “The Arabian
prophet has declared:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<dfn>Sheríát</dfn>, ‘the law,’ is like night; <dfn>Taríkat</dfn>, ‘religious rule,’ is
like the stars; <dfn>Hakiket</dfn>, ‘the truth,’ is like the moon; and <dfn>Mârifet</dfn>,
‘the true knowledge,’ like the sun; and nothing is superior to the sun.”</p>

<p>Míyán Báyezíd Róshen said: “The matter of the
law rests upon the five fundamental principles of
the Muselmans.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_25" id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">35</span>
Pronouncing the words of the faith, and joining
to the words the belief in their truth; these are
the actions of the law. The <dfn>tasbíh</dfn>, “rosary;” the
<dfn>tahlíl</dfn>, “praise of God;” the being constantly employed
in the verbal commemoration of the <em>attributes
of God</em>; the guarding of the heart from temptation:
this is the business of <dfn>taríkat</dfn>, “religious rule.”</p>

<p>To keep the fast of the month Ramazan, and to
abstain from eating, drinking, and sexual intercourse;
this is the business of <dfn>sheríât</dfn>, “the law.”
Fasting beyond the demands of duty; not filling the
belly, but training it to a scanty diet; and restraining
the body from what is bad: this is the
business of <dfn>taríkat</dfn>.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Zacat</dfn>, “stated alms,” and the giving of the
tithe, is the business of <dfn>sheríât</dfn>; but the distribution
of food and raiment to the fakírs and performers of
fasts, and the taking by the hand the distressed, is
the business of <dfn>taríkat</dfn>.</p>

<p>To perform the circuit around the house of the
friend of God,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_26" id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span>
and to be free from wickedness, and
crime, and warring, is the business of the <span class="title">sheríât</span>;
but to perform the circuit of the house of the friend
of God, to wit the heart,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_27" id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span>
to combat bodily propensities,
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pageno">36</span>
and to worship the angels, is the business of
<span class="title">taríkat</span>.</p>

<p>To meditate constantly on the Almighty God, to
place confidence in the instructions received, to discard
from the heart the exterior veil, and to fix the
view on the perfection of the celestial object of our
affection: this is the business of <dfn>hakíkat</dfn>, “truth.”</p>

<p>To view the nature of God with the eye of the
heart, and to see him face to face in every mansion
and on every side, with the light of the intellect, and
to cause no injury to the creatures of the All-Just:
this is the business of <dfn>mârifat</dfn>, “true knowledge.”</p>

<p>To know the All-Just, and to perceive and comprehend
the sound of the <dfn>tasbíh</dfn>, “rosary:” this is
the business of <dfn>kurbet</dfn>, “proximity to God.”</p>

<p>To choose self-abnegation, to perform every thing
in the essence of the All-Nourisher, to practise
renunciation of all superfluities, and to carry in one’s
self the proof of the true sense of the divine union:
this is <dfn>váśalet</dfn>, “union with God.”</p>

<p>To annihilate one’s self before Deity absolute, and
<em>in God</em> to be eternal and absolute; to become one
with the unity, and to beware of evil: this is the
business of <dfn>touhíd</dfn>, “coalescence with God.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_28" id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>To become an inmate and resident, to assume the
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pageno">37</span>
attributes of God absolute, to divorce from one’s own
attributes: this is the business of <dfn>sacúnat</dfn>, “in-dwelling
in God,” and there is no superior station
beyond <dfn>sacúnat</dfn>.</p>

<p>The terms <dfn>kurbat</dfn>, <dfn>váśalet</dfn>, <dfn>vahed</dfn>, and <dfn>sacúnat</dfn> are
peculiar to the style of the lord Miyán Róshen Báyezíd,
who places them higher than <dfn>sheríât</dfn>, <dfn>térikat</dfn>, and
<dfn>mârifat</dfn>.</p>

<p>At that time it was the custom, when friends had
been separated and met again, on meeting, their
first inquiries were about the health, wealth, and
children of each other. But the friends of Miyán
Róshen Báyezid first inquired about each other’s
faith, religious thoughts, zeal, love, and knowledge
of the All-Just, and afterwards about their health
and welfare. When they made inquiry about any
other person, it was in the following manner:
“How is he with respect to religion and faith?
does he keep the affection of the friends of God?”
and in these things they rejoiced. The words of
the prophet are:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Verily, God does not regard your forms nor your wealth,</div>
  <div class="i0">But he regards your hearts and your actions.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Miyán Báyezíd, in his early years, used to conform
to the five fundamental principles of the Muselman
faith, such as the confession of faith, to say
prayers five times a-day, and to keep the fasts; but
as he was not possessor of a sufficient estate, it was
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>
not necessary for him to give the stated alms. He
was desirous to perform the pilgrimage, but he was
then too young for it, so it was postponed until he
attained the truth of his religion. The words of God
Almighty are:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Verily, I am near to mankind, nearer than their own necks; there is
no separation between me and mankind; and I am one with mankind;
but mankind know it not: nor can a man attain the knowledge of me,
unless by the means of the assiduous perusal of the sacred volume, and
not by much travel of the feet; but he may attain the knowledge of
me by ardent meditation, and, by obedience, a man becomes perfect.”</p>

<p>Thus far from the Hál-námeh of Miyán Báyazid.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Section <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>: an account of the history of the lord
Míýan Róshen Báyazíd.</span></p>

<p>Báyazid felt himself a prophet, and invited mankind
to religious austerity; he caused them to say
prayers, but indicated them no determined quarter
to which they ought to turn, as the sacred text says:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Wherever you turn, you turn towards God.”</p>

<p>He said, religious bathing in water is not necessary;
for, as soon as the wind blows upon us, the
body is purified; inasmuch as the four elements are
equally pure. He said, whoever knows not himself
and God, is not a man; and if he be hurtful, he may
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pageno">39</span>
be accounted to have the nature of a wolf, tiger, serpent,
or scorpion. The Arabian prophet has said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Kill a harmful creature before it causes harm.”</p>

<p>If such a person is well-behaved, and says prayers,
he has the disposition of an ox, or sheep, and
to kill him is lawful. On that account he ordered
his self-conceited adversaries to be killed, as they
were to be regarded as brute beasts; thus it is stated
in the Koran:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“They are like brute beasts, nay worse.”</p>

<p>He said: whoever does not know himself, and has
no notion of eternal life, and everlasting existence,
is dead, and the property of a dead man, whose heirs
are also as the dead, reverts to the living. On that
account he ordered also the killing of the ignorant.
When he found a Hindu knowing himself, he valued
him higher than a Muselman. He and his sons practised
for some time highway robbery. Of the wealth
which he took from the Muselmans and others, he
deposited the fifth part in a store-house, and when
it was wanted, he distributed it among the most
deserving people. He and his sons kept themselves
all remote from adultery, lewdness, and unbecoming
actions, as well as from despoiling the unitarians of
their property, and refrained from using violence
towards those who saw but one God.</p>

<p>He composed a great number of works in the
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pageno">40</span>
Arabic, Persian, Hindi, and Afgháni,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_29" id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span>
languages.
The <cite>Makśúd al Múmenín</cite>, “the desire of the right
“believers,” is in Arabic. They say, that the All-just
God conversed with him without the intervention of
Jabril.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_30" id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span>
He composed also a book entitled <span class="title">Kháir-al-bíán</span>,
“the good news, or the gospel,” and this in
four languages: the first in Arabic, the second in
Persian, the third in Hindi, and the fourth in <span class="title">Pashtú</span>,
that is, the Afgháni language: the same purport is
conveyed in the four languages. The address is from
the All-just All-mighty God to the lord Báyezíd,
and this they believe a work of divine inspiration.
He is also the author of the <cite>Hálnámeh</cite>, in which he
has given an account of himself.</p>

<p>The most astonishing circumstance therein is,
that he was an illiterate man, and yet expounded
the Koran, and uttered speeches full of truth, so that
learned men were astonished at them.</p>

<p>It is said that Báyezid received the divine command
for the destruction of those who know no
God. Three times the all-just God had given him
the order, and he put not his hand to the sword;
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pageno">41</span>
but when it was repeated, unable to resist, he girt
himself for the war against the infidels.</p>

<p>Báyezid was contemporary with the lord Mirzá
Muhammed Hakim, the son of the lord Humáyún
Pádshah. The author of this book has heard from
Mirza sháh Muhammed, surnamed Ghazni Khán,
the following account: “It was in the year of the
Hejira 949 (A. D. 1542-3), that Miyàn Róshen
gained strength and established his sect. My father,
<span class="person">Sháh Baighkán</span> Arghún, surnamed Khán-Dourán,
said, he saw Míyán Báyezíd before his rising
in rebellion, when he was brought to the court of
Mirzá Muhammed Hakím, and the learned were
confounded in the dispute with him, wherefore
they let him take his departure on equitable
terms.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_31" id="fnanchor_31"></a><a href="#footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></span>
In the beginning of the year of the
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pageno">42</span>
Hejira 994 (A. D. 1585-6) the intelligence of the
death of the lord Mirzá Muhammed Hakim reached
from Kabul, the ear of the Lord, dwelling in the
ninth heaven. The sepulchre of Báyezid is at Bhatakpùr,
in the hilly country of the Afghans.</p>

 Bayezid, after having obtained the adherence of several tribes of the
Afghans, established himself in <span class="place">Hashtanagar</span>, “eight townships,” in the
middle of <span class="place">Pokhtanga</span>, or Afghanistan, perhaps the country of the ancient
<span class="place">Aspagani</span>, mentioned by Pliny, and took his residence at <span class="place">Kaleder</span>, in the
district of Omazei, where he founded a city. From thence, under the
title of <span class="title">Pír roshán</span>, “master of light,” he issued proclamations to increase
the number of his followers. Having become formidable to the
government of the Moghuls, <span class="person">Mahsan khan ghazí</span>, a chief of great merit,
by a sudden irruption into Hashtanagar, seized the person of Bayezid,
and carried him to Kabul, where, although at first subject to insult, he
owed his release to the intercession of some influential persons, favorably
disposed towards him. He then retired to the mountains of <span class="place">Totee</span>, and
further to those of <span class="place">Tirah</span>, perhaps the district of the ancient <span class="place">Thiræi</span>,
mentioned by Arrian. Such was soon the new increase of his forces, that
he dared proclaim his project to overthrow the power of the emperor
Akbar. He descended into the plains of <span class="place">Ningarhar</span>, sacked and burnt
the country, but was overtaken by <span class="person">Mahsan Khan</span>, and his army routed;
he himself escaped with great difficulty, and died soon after, from the
fatigues of his flight: he was buried at Hashtanagar.&mdash;(See on the Rosheniah

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Section <abbr title="Three">III</abbr>.: upon the transactions of the sons of
the lord Míýan Bayezíd.</span></p>

<p>Omár Shaikh Kamál eddin, Nur eddin and Jelál
eddin were the sons of Báyezid,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_32" id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span>
and he had a daughter,
Kamál Khátún. After the lord Miyán Jelál
eddin succeeded to his father’s dignity, and acquired
a very great power; he never deviated from the precepts
of the lord Miyán; he was just, and an adherer
to rule, and girt with energy and activity. In the
year of the Hejira 989 (A. D. 1581-2), when the
standards of majesty of the lord (now an inhabitant
of the ninth heaven), that is, of <span class="title">Acbar Pádsháh</span>, returned
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">43</span>
from Kabul to the firm seat of government
(Delhi), he (Jelal-eddin) came to his presence, but
after some days he took to flight. In the year of
the Hejira 1000 (A. D. 1591-2), <span class="person">Jâfer Baig Kazvíní
Bakhshí</span>, who was honored with the title of Aśfakháni,
was deputed for the destruction of Jelál eddin
Róshni, whom the blessed <span class="person">Jelál eddin Muhammed Akbar</span>
called <span class="person">Jelálah</span>, and in the same year the emperor’s
chieftains, having taken prisoners the whole family
of Jelál eddin by the agency of a person called <span class="person">Vahdit
Ali</span>, brought them to the foot of the throne, the seat
of the deputy of God. In the year of the Hejira
1007 (A. D. 1598-9), during the reign of the lord,
now inhabiting heaven, Jelál eddin Acbar Pádshah,
Miyan Jelál eddin took Ghizni, and cruelly ravaged
this province, but could not maintain himself in that
position. Meanwhile, at the coming up of the <span class="title">Hazárah</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_33" id="fnanchor_33"></a><a href="#footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span>
and the Afghans upon Miyan, a great conflict
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pageno">44</span>
took place, in which Miyàn Jelál eddin was wounded
by the hand of <span class="person">Shádmán Hazárah</span>, and fled to the
mountains of Rabáth, where <span class="person">Merad Baikh</span> and some
of the followers of <span class="person">Sherif Khan Atcah</span> attacked him
and made an end of his affairs.</p>

<p>After him, <span class="person">Míyán Ahdad</span>, the son of <span class="person">Omar Shaikh</span>,
the son of <span class="person">Báyezíd</span>, who is known among the illustrious
persons by the name of <span class="person">Ahdád</span>, sat on the
throne of authority. He was just, and an adherer
to rule; he kept himself thoroughly firm in the precepts
of his august predecessor; he never intended
to amass wealth, but gave every one the due reward
of his labor; the fifth part of the wealth which was
collected from the wars against the infidels he deposited
in the public storehouse, and it served to reward
the meritorious warriors. In the year of the
Hejira 1035 (A. D. 1625-6), under the reign of the
lord, now an inhabitant of heaven, <span class="person">Nur-eddin Jehán-gír
Pádshah</span>, he was reduced to great straits by <span class="person">Ahsan
Ulla</span>, surnamed <span class="person">Zafer Khan</span>, the son of <span class="person">Khájah Abu-’l
Hassan Tabrízí</span>, and by the chieftains of the Pádshah,
and besieged in the fort <span class="place">Navágher</span>, where, hit by a
musket shot during an attack on the fortress, he
reached the term of his life. It is said that, before
the day of his death, which these sectaries call “the
day of union,” Miyán Ahdád opened the book
<cite>Kháir al Bíán</cite>, and, having read in it, said to his
friends: “To-morrow is my day of union:” and it
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pageno">45</span>
happened as he had said. The author of this book
saw a pious person from Cabul, who told him:
“On the day of Ahdad’s death I rejoiced, and spoke
of him in bad terms; at night I saw in a dream
my master, who forbade me to do so, and said the
sacred text: ‘<cite>declare that God is one</cite>,’ applies to
Ahdád.” And his disciples name him <span class="title">Ahdád</span>,
“the one.”</p>

<p>It is reported that after the “uníon” of Ahdád,
the Afghans, having taken up <span class="person">Abd ul Khader</span>, the son
of Ahdád, betook themselves to the mountains; and
the Padshah’s army, who had not expected to obtain
possession of the fort, entered it. The daughter of
Ahdad, who had not found an opportunity of escaping,
was wandering about the fortress; one of the
soldiers attempted to seize her; the maiden, having
thrown her veil over her eyes, precipitated herself
from the wall of the fort, and met her death: every
one was astonished at the deed.</p>

<p>After Miyan Ahdad, his son, Abd-ul Kader, sat
upon the throne of religious supremacy. Having
found a favorable opportunity, he attacked <span class="person">Zafer
Khán</span>, who fled with the greatest precipitation; all
his baggage, with the women of his secret apartments,
fell into the hands of the Afghans; but the
wife of Zafer khan, named <span class="person">Buzerg Khánam</span>, alone was
preserved from violence by the efforts of the chieftains,
such as Navab Sâid Khan, the son of Ahmed
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pageno">46</span>
Baig Khan Tarkhan. The author of this work himself
heard <span class="person">Perí Sultan</span>, a person from nature possessed
of vigor and worth, who has now received
the title of <span class="title">Zú-’l Fakár khán</span>, say: “When, by order
of Sâid Khan, I went to invite Abd-ul Khader to
submit, I brought with me a great variety of victuals
and liquors, that he might be seduced by
their effect. One day, an aged Afghan, after having
tasted some sweetmeats, rose on his legs and
said: ‘O Abd-ul Khader, from the time of thy
honored ancestors to this day, never the foot of
a Moghúl reached this place; he who is now
come intends to deceive thee, with garments red
and yellow, and with victuals pleasing and sweet,
which are coveted by those who are slaves of
their belly, but which are abhorrent to the
rule of durvishes: the best measure therefore
is to put him to death, as an example to terrify
others from coming hither.’ But Abd-ul Khader
and his mother, <span class="person">Bíbí Aláí</span>, the daughter of Míyan
Jelal eddin, would not agree to it. On the
day when Abd-ul Khader visited the camp of <span class="person">Sâíd
Khán</span>, his horse was frightened at the noise of the
kettle-drums and horns, and dashed from amid the
crowd to one side; an Afghan observed: ‘The
horse executes what the lord Miyan Róshen has
ordered, but you do not; be sure you shall suffer
from the after-sickness of this debauch.’
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">47</span>
Abd-ul Khader asked: ‘What has Miyan ordered?’
The Afghan replied: ‘To keep at a
distance, and to beware of the Moghuls.’” When
Abd-ul Khader presented himself at the court of the
lord <span class="person">Abúl Mazafer Shaháb-eddin Muhammed, Sáheb-i-Kerán
sání Amír al Múmenín shah Jehan Pádshah, gházy</span>,
“the victorious,” he was elevated to a high rank.
In the year of the Hejira 1043 (A. D. 1633-4) he
reached his last day, and was buried at Paishaver.</p>

<p><span class="person">Mirza</span>, the son of <span class="person">Núr-eddín</span>, lived in the reign of
the lord <span class="person">Amír al Múmenín Shah Jehán</span>, and was killed
in the battle of Dóulet-abad. Kerimdad, the son of
Jelal eddin, was delivered up by the tribe of the Jelalian
to <span class="person">Muhammed Yakub Kashmírí</span>, the <dfn>Vakíl</dfn>, “agent,”
of <span class="person">Sâíd Khán Terkhán</span>, and he was put to death in the
year of the Hejira 1048 (A. D. 1638-9). <span class="person">Alhedád
Khán</span>, the son of Jelal-eddin, having been honored
with the title of <span class="title">Rashíd Khán</span>, was appointed to a
command of four thousand in the Dekan, and ended

(A. D. 1648-9).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_34" id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span></p>

 Jelál-eddin, although supported by many, was strongly opposed by
some of the Afghan tribes; other mixed tribes never adopted the Rosheniah
creed. Among the last were the <span class="title">Házárahs</span>, distinct from the
Afghans and Moghuls; their original seat is supposed to have been between
<span class="place">Herat</span> and <span class="place">Balkh</span>; but they possessed themselves of a considerable
part between <span class="place">Ghazni</span> and <span class="place">Kandahar</span>, in one direction, and between
<span class="place">Máidan</span> and <span class="place">Balkh</span>, in the other. We find in the before quoted Memoir
of H. T. Colebrooke (<cite><abbr title="Asiatic Researches">As. Res.</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="volume Seven page">vol. VII. p.</abbr> 343): “The Házárahs of Kábul
are an innumerable tribe, who reside in Kábul, Ghazni, and Khandahar.
Many of them are Shíahs, and adherents of the holy family.
At present, among the chiefs of the Shiâhs is <span class="person">Mirza Shádmán</span>, with
whom the faithful are well pleased, and of whose incursions the <span class="title">Khárejis</span>
of Kabul and Ghuzni bitterly complain.”</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_34" id="footnote_34"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_34"><span class="muchsmaller">[34]</span></a>
 We find in the Asiatic Researches (<abbr title="volume Eleven">vol. XI.</abbr> from <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 363 to 418), a
translation of this chapter, with a Memoir on the Rosheniah sect by the
late Doctor John Leyden, whose early death in Java will ever be regretted
as a great loss to Oriental literature. In his researches relative to the
language and literature of the Afghans, he met with a work in the Afghan
or Pashtu languge, entitled <cite>Makhan Afhganí</cite>, a miscellaneous compilation
on the ritual and moral practice of Islam, composed by <span class="person">Akhun</span>
(Mulla) <span class="person">Derwezeh</span>, a character celebrated in Afghanistan chiefly for his
sanctity, and belonging to the tribe of <span class="title">Tajek</span>. This word in general
signifies “peasant, or cultivator of ground;” but is in particular applied
to those who are not Arabs, and by the Moghuls to the natives of Iran,
who are neither of Arab nor Moghul extraction, probably of a mixed
origin. They extend from the mountains of <span class="place">Chetár</span>, in <span class="place">Kashgar</span>, as far
as <span class="place">Balkh</span> and <span class="place">Kandahar</span>, and live either under their own chiefs, or subject
and tributary to the Afghans, Turkmans, or Usbek Tartars, among
whom they reside. The Tajiks always showed themselves adverse to the
Rosheniahs, and Akhun Derwezeh in the said work contradicts and blames
the tenets and opinions of Bayazid, whom he calls the “master of darkness.”
In the extract given by Leyden, of Derwezeh’s account, we see
that the doctrine of the Rosheniahs coincided in several points with that
of the Ismaîlahs: Bayazid, in like manner as the latter, established eight
degrees of perfection, through which his sectaries were to pass, and which
led to an entire dereliction of all positive religion, and an unrestrained
licentiousness in manners and practices. The account given by the
author of the Dabistan is far from provoking so severe a blame. As to
the history of Bayazid’s life and that of his son&mdash;highway robbery,
devastation, and bloodshed are evidently practised by them, in the recital
of both authors. The Memoir of the learned Leyden abounds with curious
and important information respecting the Afghan tribes, to which the
present events in Western India can but lend a higher interest. Some
reputed followers of Bayazid are still to be found both in Paishavir and
Kabul, most numerous among the wild tribes of the <span class="title">Yusefzei</span>.</p>

author of this book heard from <span class="person">Khájah Masâud</span>,
the son of <span class="person">Khájah Mahmúd</span>, the son of <span class="person">Khájah Mirshed
al hak</span>, who was a pious master of worldly concerns,
what follows: “My honored father said he had
heard from his noble ancestors, that the lord of
the faith and of the world will appear; but he
knew not whether that lord’s time was already
come, or will come; meanwhile he saw him one
night in a dream; when he rose from sleep, he
went to the country where that august personage
was born, that is on Sunday of the month <span class="time">Rajeb</span>
(the seventh Arabian month), in the year of the
Hejira 949 (A. D. 1543), the lord <span class="person">Jelal eddin Akbar</span>,
the august son of <span class="person">Hamáyún Pádshah</span> and of the
praise-worthy <span class="person">Bánú Bêgam</span> was born.” The writer
of this work heard also in the year of the Hejira 1053
(A. D. 1643-4), in Lahore, from <span class="person">Mirzá Sháh Muhammed</span>,
surnamed <span class="person">Khaznín Khán</span>, the son of shah <span class="person">Baigh
Khán</span>, with the surname of <span class="person">Khán Douran</span>, a native of
Arghún, who is said to have asked from the Naváb
<span class="person">Azíz Kóka</span>, surnamed <span class="person">Khán Aâzem</span>, what observation
he had to make upon the rumor current relative to
the Lord, the inhabitant of the ninth heaven, as to
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">50</span>
his being like the Messiah? He answered: “What
the mother said, is the truth.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_35" id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span></p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Section II.&mdash;On the dispute of the people of
different religions.</span></p>

<p>In the service of the khalifah were two learned
persons, the one a Sonnite, and the other a Shiâh,
who both sought admittance at court. The emperor
called them, and by their desire in his presence
they endeavored to establish the truth of their respective
religions. The Shiâh said: “It is evident
that the Sonnites are without faith, because they
do not acknowledge the prophet’s purity, and say
that David caused Uriá to be killed.” The Sonnite
replied: “This fact is equally mentioned in the
Koran and in the <dfn>Tóurít</dfn>, ‘Pentateuch,’ explicitly
and circumstantially.” A Jew was present, and
affirmed: “It is certainly in the Pentateuch.” Upon
which the Shiâh rejoined: “The Pentateuch is altered.”
The Jew retorted: “We may as well,
and with a better right, say that your book is
altered, whilst there is no reason to be urged that
the Pentateuch is corrupted.” The Shiâh had
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pageno">51</span>
no answer to give, and the author of this book saw
in the treatises of several of the modern learned, that
they have appropriated this answer to themselves.
The Shiâh again said: “The godly Ali was a very
learned and most excellent man, and never polluted
his lips with wine, nor pork, nor any thing
dressed by the infidels.” To which the Sonnite
replied: “As with you the hand of an infidel is impure,
and the Korésh all drank wine and eat pork,
the prophet, who associated with them, eat the
same food in the house of his paternal uncles, and
so did the lord, the godly Ali.” The Shiâh had
no suitable reply to make to this observation; he
continued however: “In the <span class="title">Malul</span> and <span class="title">Nahel</span>, it is
stated that the pure Fátima<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_36" id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span>
declared, The palmgrove
of <span class="title">Fedak</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_37" id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span> is my inheritance, as the lord of
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">52</span>
the prophetic asylum committed it to me as a
<dfn>tamlík</dfn> (hereditary property) during his life-time.
But the prophet has said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“‘We, the company of prophets, do not leave to our heirs what has
been bestowed on us as a gift or as alms.’</p>

<p>“On the strength of which Sádik (Abu bekr)
rejected her claim. But even were this tradition
irrefragable, how could he reject the claim of a
<span class="title">tamlík</span>, if that tradition, by which the rejection of
such an inheritance never takes place, be acknowledged
to be right?” The Sonnite opposed to
this: “The splendid lady had no witnesses that
the law could accept; as the evidence of husband,
or son, or grandson, is not admissible.”
The Shiâh insisted: “Sádik was wrong. And the
burning of the court<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_38" id="fnanchor_38"></a><a href="#footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></span>
in sequel of the mortal
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">53</span>
malady of the prophet; and the repentance which
was the consequence of it? and the like, what
dost thou say about it? Moreover, Omar’s impeding
the writing of a last will in the mortal
malady of the prophet, as the Imám <span class="person">Ismâíl Bokhárí</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_39" id="fnanchor_39"></a><a href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span>
has related upon the authority of <span class="person">Abd-ulla</span>,
the son of <span class="person">Abas</span>, that in his mortal malady the
house of the prophet was full of his companions.
He said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">‘Make haste, let me put down a writing for your sake, in order that,
after me, you may be safe against error and deceit.’</p>

<p>“But Omar said: ‘The prophet is overcome by
the malady, and his intellect is obstructed; the
heavenly book, and the proofs of the text of the
Koran are sufficient for us.’ On which account
accumulated contradictions and conflicting
discussions rose to such a height that the prophet
said: ‘Leave me.’ The Sonnite resumed:
The prophet himself declared:</p>

<p class="blockquote"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pageno">54</span>
‘I am a man like you, but I speak from inspiration.’</p>

<p>“In eating, dress, repose, affliction, health, sickness,
wounds, in life and death, his condition was
that of mankind: thus, some teeth of the venerable
were knocked out,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_40" id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span>
and in his last malady
he was exceedingly suffering, so that in the violence
of his pain he might have said things which
were not consonant with a sound mind. On that
account Omar forbade his writing.” The Shiâh
remarked: “When the prophet had left the garment
of mortality, Omar drew his sword, and threatened
to kill whosoever would say that the prophet
died, because he was still living; such a declaration,
how can it be reconciled with his impeding
the writing of the last will in the manner before
said?” The Sonnite avowed: “Mankind is subject
to error.” The Shiâh pressed further: “After
the contention, when Osmân was appointed
khalif, his relations of the family of Omiyah
practised oppression under his authority, and he
brought back Hakim, the son of Aś,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_41" id="fnanchor_41"></a><a href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></span>
the son of
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pageno">55</span>
Omiyah, to Medina, from whence the prophet had
banished him, so that he was called ‘the banished
of the prophet,’ although Sádik (Abubekr) and
Fárúk (Omar) had not called him. Further, Osman
expelled Abázer from Medina; he also gave
his daughter in marriage to Merván, the son of
Hakim, with the fifth part of the spoils of Afrika,
which amounted to forty thousand gold dinárs.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_42" id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span>

Besides, he granted security to Abd-ullah, the son
of Serj;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_43" id="fnanchor_43"></a><a href="#footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></span>
although the lord of the prophetic asylum
had ordered his blood to be shed; and he
conferred on him the administration of Egypt;
he consigned also to Abd-ullah, the son of Aamar,
the government of Baśra, where he indulged
himself in all sorts of shameful actions. Among
the Umrás of his army were <span class="person">Máavíah</span>, the son of
Abi Safián, the collector of <span class="person">Shám</span> (Syria), and <span class="person">Sâíd</span>,
the son of <span class="person">Alâaś</span>, the collector of Kúfa. Afterwards,
<span class="person">Abd-ullah</span>, the son of <span class="person">Aamer</span>; and <span class="person">Valíd</span>, the
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pageno">56</span>
son of <span class="person">Akba Abd-ullah</span>, the son of <span class="person">Sâd</span>, the son of
<span class="person">Abí Serj</span>; all these trod the road of perverseness
and unrighteousness.” The Sonnite had no convenient
reply to make. The Shiâh continued:
“The prophet sent three friends to fight to a place
called <span class="place">Tabúk</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_44" id="fnanchor_44"></a><a href="#footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></span>
they disagreed: after which the
prophet declared: ‘Whoever causes discord in
the army or service, the curse of God be upon
him.’” The Sonnite here fell in: “At the time
of the prophet’s moving, it was not advisable to
undertake the expedition designed; there was no
disunion about the war among them; but only a
discussion about the fitting out of the troops and
the arrangements; whence a delay in this affair
arose, on account of settling the proper order of
march and other proceedings.” The Shiâh went
on: “What the Sonnites attribute to God and the
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pageno">57</span>
prophet, cannot be ascribed to the lowest man.”
The Sonnite asked: “What is that?” The Shiâh
answered: “One of these things, stated in the book
of your traditions, is that the lord prophet, having
exhibited before Aâisha dance and disport, asked
her: ‘Art thou satisfied?’ Such a thing cannot
in truth be said of any body without disgrace.
Besides, there are acts unbecoming of the prophet’s
companions, such as Omar’s preventing
Muhammed’s last will, and the like, avowed by
themselves in their book; and yet they hold these
men in high esteem!” Here the Sonnite observed:
“What thou first settest forth about the prophet’s
exhibition of disport, is nothing shameful; as to
what thou sayest about bad customs, they belong
only to thy own vicious opinion. Deniest thou
that the prophet has said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">‘I am sent to settle the customs and manners.’</p>

<p>“If a fact has not existed or has not happened,
why should it have been recorded?” The Shiâh
called out: “It has been invented and formed into
a lie.” The Sonnite objected: “Thus, according
to thy opinion, the master of truth, Bokhari and
the like, are tellers of lies, and thus they have
transmitted lies! Why then, on their authority
believest thou that Omar has prevented the making
of the last will, and other such things, which,
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">58</span>
according to thee throw blame upon the companions
of the prophet? Therefore, in whatever of
all these things according to thy opinion is unbecoming,
thou shoulst believe that the master of
truth, Bokhâri, and those like him, have told lies,
so wouldst thou cease to cast reproach upon the
companions and friends of the prophet; but if they
spoke truth, then reckon also to be true, what
they have attributed as praise-worthy to the prophet,
and true what they have stated of the virtues
of the said companions. Further, as to thy separating
the prophet from mankind, it belongs, as it
has been revealed by the divine text, to the creed
of unbelievers to say, that the prophet should not
eat nor drink.” Now the Shiâh grew warm, and
said: “Is it not enough to attach to the lord prophet
the blame of having listened to music and
assisted at dancing; and now thou pretendest to
prove the purity of the two Shaikhs (Abubekr and
Omar) and of Osmán!” The Sonnite took up
the controversy: “I said before that listening to
music is reasonably not blamable, and even laudable,
when a lawgiver also listens to it, and I
observed, concerning customs and manners, that
thou esteemest bad what thou hast badly understood.
As thou refusest to approve dancing,
what sayest thou about the interdiction of a woman
from her spouse at the desire of the prophet?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_45" id="fnanchor_45"></a><a href="#footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></span>

<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pageno">59</span>
If thou holdest the example of customary
acts reprehensible, there is nothing to be said
about such an occurrence. And likewise, if the
two Shaikhs had not been pure, the lord prophet
would not have exalted their heads by matrimonial
alliance; and the daughter of the lord Ali and
the lord prophet would never have been in the
house of the great <span class="person">Fáruk</span> (Omar), and of the possessor
of two lights (Osman). To open the road
of contention is not laudable; and if not so according
to thy opinion, explain this to me: since
the lord, the lion of God (Ali) was informed of all
the secrets of the hearts, why did he wage war
upon Mâaviah, who was a Muselmán? and why
was he the death of so many men, since causing
death is by no means right?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_46" id="fnanchor_46"></a><a href="#footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></span>
It is likewise known
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pageno">60</span>
and admitted by you as true that, when one day a
Muselman was selling garlic and onions upon the
passage of the prophet, that venerable personage
told him: ‘If thou wouldst sit down in a corner,
retiring out of my way, it would be well.’
The man made an excuse, and the prophet passed
on. Shortly after came Alí, who said to the man:
‘The prophet dislikes the smell of onions and
garlic, therefore move out of his way.’ The man
answered: ‘O Alí, the prophet told me to rise,
and I did not move.’ Alí said: ‘At the prophet’s
order thou didst not rise?’ He drew
immediately his sword, and cut off the man’s
head. Such an action is reprobated by the law,
as the lord of the prophetic asylum forbade killing
even the hostile unbelievers, saying:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“‘Do not exceed in shedding blood, even if thou be a conqueror.’</p>

<p>“And by historical accounts it is known that he
has blamed Ibrahim for having driven an unbeliever
from his board. Nushírván,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_47" id="fnanchor_47"></a><a href="#footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></span>
who was not
crowned with the diadem of the right faith, is celebrated,
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pageno">61</span>
because he sat upon the throne of justice,
and one of his most approved actions was, that
he withheld his hand from an old woman’s house,
which was an hinderance in the vicinity of his
palace, and preferred to waste his own fields;
and the lord of the prophetic asylum, because
he appeared upon the field of testimony in the time
of this king, exalted his fame and glory by these
words:</p>

<p class="blockquote">‘I was born in the time of the just king.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_48" id="fnanchor_48"></a><a href="#footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“How can it be right to believe that the prophet,
the last of the age, should be pleased with the
destruction of a Muselman; he who would not
disturb the people who, engaged in their trade
and occupation, obstructed his passage? he who
said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">‘He who kills willingly a believer shall have hell for eternal
punishment;’</p>

<p class="unindent">“He cannot have acted by that rule; he who declares:</p>

<p class="blockquote"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pageno">62</span>
“‘God will not give to a soul more trouble than it can bear;’</p>

<p class="unindent">“Such an action is not that of a virtuous man; this
however is related (of Alí) by your learned men,
and likewise joking and buffooning, which indicates
a want of dignity, degraded him.” The
Shiâh said: “Nevertheless, he was certainly the
most excellent of all the companions of the prophet.”
The Sonnite asked: “In knowledge or
in practice?” The Shiâh replied: “In both
knowledge and practice.” The Sonnite resumed:
“This we do not hold for certain; in what respect
was he superior in practice to the chief of the believers,
Omar?” The Shiâh answered: “Alí used
to pray the whole night.” The Sonnite rejoined:
“According to your own account, the lord Ali
wanted a woman every night; and his custom,
(called <dfn>matâh</dfn>)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_49" id="fnanchor_49"></a><a href="#footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></span>
was to engage one for a short time;
and so many did he occupy, that he seemed an
unceasing bridegroom;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_50" id="fnanchor_50"></a><a href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></span>
how could a person so
employed pray the whole night? unless in your
religion you call praying what we call by another
name.” The Shiâh interrupted him saying:
“You are liars from the very beginning. Abu Hanífa,
your great Imám, was a native of Kabul, and
attached himself particularly to the service of
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pageno">63</span>
Imám Jâfr Sádik; at last he left him, and professed
openly the religion of his fathers, who were
Magi. A sign of the Magian creed was, that he
thought it right to eat three times a-day, and to lay
aside all choice of diet, as well as not to reckon
the unbelievers impure, saying that impurity
resides in the interior, if any where, and the
like.”</p>

<p>The Sonnite remarked: “Thou thyself agreest that
Abu Hanífa was a follower of the Imám Jâfr, therefore
he most likely practised what was conformable
to the religion of the Imám Jâfr. We do
not admit that your people are attached to the
religion of the Imám; we rather believe that they
are Magi; for when your ancestors were conquered
and subjected, they, by necessity, joined the Islámian,
but mixed the right faith with the creed of
the Magi: as it appears from the worship called
<dfn>nóu róz</dfn>, which is a custom of the Magi; according
to whom they likewise perform divine worship
three times a day. They think it right to turn
the head in praying to the left, which is turning
off from the Kiblah (of Mecca); they assert that
the five prayers every day are improper, as they
are not able to perform them exactly; they maintain,
however, as requisite those at midday, before
sunset, and in the evening on going to sleep. In
the same manner, they took the <dfn>matâh</dfn>, or temporary
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pageno">64</span>
matrimonial unions, from the Mazhdakian.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_51" id="fnanchor_51"></a><a href="#footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>All the Shiâhs have founded their creed upon
two rules: the first is the <dfn>Bedas</dfn> (Védas); these
were promulgated with the view to surround us
with power and magnificence, or with the modes of
happiness, which brilliant prospects have not been
realized; it was said that the lord of divine majesty
dictated the Veda. The second rule is godliness;
by which men are freed from all the propensities
of nature. The Shiâhs are of this persuasion;
and when they are asked about the manner of it,
they say: By means of godliness we experience the
non-reality of exterior things.</p>

<p>The Vedá treats of theology, and of what may
appear contrary to divinity; it explains the will<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_52" id="fnanchor_52"></a><a href="#footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></span>

which on the part of the perverse may be manifested
contrary to the will of the (supreme) judge.
The Véda moreover treats of practice: when an
action tends towards one thing, and when, after
or before its accomplishment, it turns towards something
else.</p>

<p><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pageno">65</span>
The unbelievers, who are in opposition to the
prophet assert, that he has adopted the morals of
Amrál Kaîs<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_53" id="fnanchor_53"></a><a href="#footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></span>
and mixed them with the Koran, that
likewise he has frequently made use therein of the
ideas of other poets, and even frequently gave place
in it to the usages of paganism, with which he
had been pleased. There are other controversies
current. It will be best to attend to the following
observation: What avail the doubts of the Shiâhs?
They attack in their speeches the Vicars of the
prophet; when the first party (the Sonnites) repress
the answer to it upon their tongues, let the other
party too refrain from dispute.</p>

<p>The arguments being carried to this point, the
khalif of God dismissed the parties.</p>

<p>One day a Nazarene came to pay his submissive
respects to the khalif of God, and challenged any of
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pageno">66</span>
learned among the Muselmans to dispute with him.
The proposal being accepted, the Nazarene began:
“Do you believe in Aisa (Jesus)?” The Muselman
answered: “Certainly; we acknowledge him as a
prophet of God; our prophet bore testimony to
the divine mission of Jesus.” The Nazarene continued:
“This prophet (the Messiah) has announced
that after him many will appear who will pretend
to a prophetic office; yet ‘believe not in them,
nor follow them, for they are liars; but remain
you steadfast and firm in my faith, until I come
again.’ There is no mention of your prophet in
the Gospel.” The Muselman replied: “Mention
of him was in the Pentateuch<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_54" id="fnanchor_54"></a><a href="#footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></span>
and in the Gospel,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_55" id="fnanchor_55"></a><a href="#footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></span>

<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pageno">67</span>
but your principal men obliterated it.” The
Nazarene asked: “Do you possess that Gospel
which is correct?” The Muselman avowed: “We
do not.” Then the Nazarene resumed: “Hence
your falsehood is evident; you deny the Gospel;
for if you did not, you would preserve it, as we,
who are Christians, preserve the Pentateuch,
which is the book of Moses; but you keep neither
the Pentateuch nor the Gospel, and if there had
been mentioned in the Gospel any thing of your
prophet, we would without doubt, according to
the words of Jesus, adhere to it, because, in conformity
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">68</span>
with our faith, our desire is to obey the
precepts of Jesus. But now, whence can we
know that your prophet is true?” The Muselman
said: “From his miracles, one of which is
the dividing of the moon.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_56" id="fnanchor_56"></a><a href="#footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></span>
The Nazarene observed
upon this: “If the dividing of the moon has
taken place, the inhabitants of the world must
have seen it, and the recorders of extraordinary
things in all countries, and the historians of all
nations would have written it down with the pen
of truth. Now none, except Muselmans, give any
information of it.” There was an Hindú present;
the Nazarene asked him: “In the Kali yug, which
is the fourth of your ages, has the moon been once
divided?” And he addressed the same question
to the Persians and Turks there present; all said:
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">69</span>
“We have not seen any thing like it, in our historical
accounts.” The Muselman remained confounded.</p>

<p>Another day, a Jew presented himself; the lord
khalif of God placed the Nazarene in opposition to
him for a religious discussion. The Jew began:
“In the Pentateuch, there is no mention made of
Jesus.” The Nazarene replied: “How not?
Does not David say: ‘My hands and my feet fall
off, and all my bones are counted.’ This is a
prediction of the sufferings and of the crucifixion
of Jesus.” The Jew remarked upon this: “Whatever
David may have said of himself, and the All-Just
have announced by his tongue, should all this
be taken for a prediction of Jesus?” The Nazarene
pursued: “But the conception of a virgin was
predicted, and this virgin was Mary.” The Jew
objected: “Amongst us, the virginity of Mary is not
proved, as, according to your belief, before the
birth of Jesus, she was married to Joseph the
carpenter, and Jesus is said to be the son of Joseph
the carpenter.” The Nazarene admitted: “This
is true; but,” he added: “Joseph had never
touched Mary.” The Jew opposed: “How is
that proved?” And this was the question which
the Jew repeated at every thing which the Nazarene
brought forward, so that the latter was reduced to
silence.</p>

<p><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">70</span>
A learned philosopher came into the hall, where
Hindus also were present, and three other learned
men; a Muselman, a Nazarene, and a Jew: these
were summoned, and ranged in opposition to the
learned philosopher. The latter opened the discussion
in this manner: “The divine mission of
your prophets has not been proved, for several reasons:
the first is, that whatever the prophet says
ought to be conformable to reason; the second is,
that he ought to be free from crime, and not hurtful
to other beings. But Moses, according to the
opinion of the Jews, was brought up by Pharâoh,
and yet he caused him by a stratagem to be
drowned in the waters of the Nile, and listened
not to his repentance. What they say of the
water of the Nile having opened a passage to
Moses, is an error. Nor did he attend to the
repentance of Kárún (Korah),<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_57" id="fnanchor_57"></a><a href="#footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></span>
but, from covetousness
of gold, he caused him to be swallowed
up by the earth. Jesus permitted the killing
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">71</span>
and ill using of animals. And Muhammed
himself attacked the forces and caravans of the
Koreish; he shed blood, nay, with his own hand
put to death animated beings. He besides exceeded
all bounds in sexual connexions, and in
taking the wives of other men; so that, on account
of his gazing, a wife was separated from her husband,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_58" id="fnanchor_58"></a><a href="#footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></span>

and the like are notorious of him. With
these perverse qualities, how then shall we recognise
a prophet?” All concurred in declaring:
“By miracles.” The philosopher asked: “What
are the miracles of your prophets?” The Jew
answered: “Thou must have heard of Moses’s
wand, which became a serpent.” The doctor
immediately took up his girdle, breathed upon it,
and it became a great serpent, which hissed and
turned towards the Jew; but the philosopher
stretched out his hand, and took it back, saying:
“Lo, the miracle of Moses!” whilst the Jew, from
fear, had scarcely any life left in his body, and
could not recover his breath again. Now the Christian
said: “The Messiah was born without a father.”
The doctor replied: “You yourselves
say that Joseph, the carpenter, had taken Mary
to wife; how can it be made out that Jesus was
not the son of Joseph?” The Nazarene was reduced
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
to silence. The Mahomedan took up the
word, and said: “Our prophet brought forth the
Korán, divided the moon, and ascended to heaven.”
The philosopher observed upon this: “It
is stated in your sacred book:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“‘And they say: We will by no means believe on thee, until thou
cause a spring of water to gush forth for us out of the earth, or thou
have a garden of palm trees and vines, and thou cause rivers to spring
forth from the midst of this palm plantation; or that thou throw down
upon the earth the heaven torn in pieces; or that thou bring down
God Almighty and the angels to vouch for thee; or thou have a house
of gold; or thou ascend by a ladder to heaven: neither will we
believe thy ascending, until thou cause a book to descend unto us
which we may read. The answer is in this way: Say, O Muhammed,
pure is God the nourisher, I am but a man-prophet.’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_59" id="fnanchor_59"></a><a href="#footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“From this an equitable judge can conclude, he
who could not cause a spring of running water
to come forth, how could he have shown the miracles
which are related of him? when he had not
the power of tearing the heaven in pieces, in what
manner could he divide the moon? when he was
unable to show the angels, how could he see Jabrííl
with his own eyes? and his companions too
did not behold him in the shape of an Arab; when
he was unable, in the presence of unbelievers, to
go to heaven with his body, how did he perform
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">73</span>
the bodily ascension (ascribed to him in the Koran)?
As he brought thence no writing, in what
way came the Koran down from heaven?”</p>

<p>A follower of Zerdusht, who stood in a corner,
now interrupted the philosopher, saying: “Maintain
all this, but do not deny miracles <em>in general</em>,
for our prophet too ascended to heaven.” The
doctor replied: “You admit the existence of Yezdán
and Ahrimán, in order that Yezdán may not
be said to be the author of evil; but you also assert,
that Ahrimán sprung forth from the evil thought
of the all-just Lord; therefore he sprung from
God, and evil originates from God, the All-Just:
you are therefore wrong in the fundamental principle,
the very root of your religion, and wrong
must be every branch which you derive from it.”</p>

<p>A learned Brahman here took up the discussion:
“Thou deniest the prophetic missions; but our
Avatárs rest upon these missions.” The doctor
said: “You at first acknowledge one God, and then
you say that, having descended from his solitude,
he assumed a great body; but God is not clothed
with a body, which belongs to contingency and
tangible matter. In like manner, you attribute
wives to your gods. Vishnu, who according to
some represents the second person of the divine
triad, according to others, is acknowledged as the
supreme God, is said to have descended from his
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">74</span>
station, and become incarnate at different times,
in the forms of a fish, a boar, a tortoise, and of
man. When he was in the state of Rama, his
wife was ravished from him. He was ignorant,
and acquired some knowledge by becoming the
disciple of one among the sages of India, until he
was freed from his body; in the form of Krishna
he was addicted to lust and deceit, of which you
yourselves tell many stories. You state, that in
this incarnation there was little of the wisdom of
a supreme God, and much of the corporeal matter
of Krishna: thus you compel mankind, who,
capable of justice, are superior to all sorts of animals,
to worship a boar or a tortoise! And you
adore the form of the male organ as Mahadeva,
whom many acknowledge to be God, and the
female organ as his wife! You seem not to know
that the irrational cannot be the creator of the
rational; that the one, uncompounded, is incompatible
with division, and that plurality of the
self-existent one is absurd. Finally, by the worship
of a mean object, no perfection can accrue to
the noble.” By these proofs and arguments he
established his theses, and the Brahman remained
confounded.</p>

<p>Afterwards the philosopher addressed the assembly:
“Know for certain that the perfect prophet and
learned apostle, the possessor of fame, <dfn>Akbar</dfn>, that
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">75</span>
is, the lord of wisdom, directs us to acknowledge
that the self-existent being is the wisest teacher,
and ordains the creatures with absolute power,
so that the intelligent among them may be able to
understand his precepts; and as reason renders
it evident that the world has a Creator, all-mighty
and all-wise, who has diffused upon the field of
events among the servants, subject to vicissitudes,
numerous and various benefits which are worthy
of praise and thanksgiving; therefore, according
to the lights of our reason, let us investigate the
mysteries of his creation, and, according to our
knowledge, pour out the praises of his benefits;
and as, by the knowledge of the primordial omnipotence,
we shall have found the direction to the
right way, we shall, in proportion to our gratitude,
be led to the reward of yon exuberant beatitude;
if, by denying the unity and disowning
the benefits of God we sink into guilt, shall we
not be deserving of punishment? Such being the
case, why should we pay obedience to any person
who belongs to mankind as ourselves, and who is
subject to anger and lust, and avarice and passion,
and love of rank and power, even more than ourselves?
If this mortal exhorts us to knowledge
and gratitude, we may by the concurrence of our
own reason obtain this advantage; but if he urges
his precepts by what is opposite to reason, then
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">76</span>
his speech is a proof of deceit; for reason demonstrates
that the world has a wise creator, and that
he, being wise, prescribes to the creatures a worship
which to their reason does not evince itself
as an evil; and whatever is proved bad, is not
ordered by him. Now the law contains particulars
which reason accounts as false or bad: such
are conversations with God; the descent of incorporeal
heavenly beings in human forms or in
the shape of a tortoise; the reascension to heaven
in an elemental body; the pilgrimage to particular
edifices for performance of worship; the circuit
(round the Kába), the entrance in it, the
fatigue, the throwing of stones;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_60" id="fnanchor_60"></a><a href="#footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></span>
the acquitting
one’s self of the pilgrimage to Mecca; the kissing
of the black stone. If it be said that, without a
visible medium, it is impossible to worship the
all-mighty Creator, and that a place for the sake
of connexion is to be fixed, it may be answered,
that one who offers praises and thanks to God, has
no need of a medium and of a place; and if a fixed
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">77</span>
place were to be admitted, the forms of the stars
above would be preferable. If it be objected, that
this cannot be free from the detestable suspicion
of paganism, whilst, certainly, a place among
others having been fixed, which place, by distinction
from them all, presents itself to them as
particular, a predilection for it appeared proper.
In like manner, after a computation of dimensions,
geometricians and mathematicians determine a
place which, with respect to the objects and
points of a space, bears the same relation as the
centre to a circle; then, without doubt, every
portion of the circumference will have its particular
relative situation with respect to the point of
the centre; certainly, in consequence of this arrangement,
all places so determined become referable
to this particular place, and among the other
places, shall be worthy of predilection.” <em>To this
may be answered</em>: “This opinion agrees not with
the ideas of many distinguished persons; for a
great number confers upon the site of another
place the attribute of being the middle, and distinguish
it as such; which is evident from the books
of the institutes of Brahma and of others, and by
the necessity of pronouncing benedictions there.
This also cannot be free from the suspicion of
paganism: because one may suppose that God,
the All-Just, is represented in the house, or is a
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pageno">78</span>
body, on which account people call it ‘the house
of God.’ If it be so, or if the Kábah be situated
in the midst of a country, other prophets may
have chosen another place, such as the holy house
(of Jerusalem), and the like; but this is but by
error; thus it happened&mdash;that, at first, the lord
Muhammed did not offer his prayers at the Kâbah.
Since therefore the detestable suspicion of paganism
rests upon all the worship of stone, earth, and
bodies, then water, fire, and the planets, are objects
more proper to be honored; and if a centre be
desired, let it be the sun in the midst of the seven
heavens. In like manner objectionable is the
sacrifice of animals, and the interdiction of what
may be proper for the food of men, and the admitting
thereof by one prophet to be lawful what is
forbidden by another. Thus, if it be not right to
eat pork, why was it permitted by Jesus? if it
was interdicted on account of pollution in consequence
of the animal’s feeding upon unclean and
nasty things, so the cock is objectionable for the
same reasons. Similar to these are most other
commands, and contrary to the precepts of reason.
But the greatest injury comprehended in a prophetic
mission is the obligation to submit to one
like ourselves of the human species, who is subject
to the incidental distempers and imperfections
of mankind; and who nevertheless controls
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pageno">79</span>
others with severity, in eating, drinking, and in
all their other possessions, and drives them about
like brutes, in every direction which he pleases;
who declares every follower’s wife he desires, legal
for himself and forbidden to the husband; who
takes to himself nine wives,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_61" id="fnanchor_61"></a><a href="#footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></span>
whilst he allows no
more than four to his followers; and even of these
wives he takes whichever he pleases for himself;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_62" id="fnanchor_62"></a><a href="#footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></span>

and who grants impunity for shedding blood to
whomsoever he chooses. On account of what excellency,
on account of what science, is it necessary
to follow that man’s command; and what proof is
there to establish the legitimacy of his pretensions?
If he be a prophet by his simple word, his word,
because it is only a word, has no claim of superiority
over the words of others. Nor is it possible
to know which of the sayings be correctly
his own, on account of the multiplicity of contradictions
in the professions of faith. If he be a
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pageno">80</span>
prophet on the strength of miracles, then the
deference to it is very dependent; because a miracle
is not firmly established, and rests only upon
tradition or a demon’s romances: as the house of
tradition, from old age, falls in ruins, it deserves
no confidence. Besides, by the regulation of divine
providence, occult sciences are numerous;
and the properties of bodies without end or number.
Why should it not happen that such a phenomenon,
which thou thinkest to be a miracle, be
nothing else but one of the properties of several
bodies, or a strange effect of the occult art? As
with thee, the dividing of the moon, of which
thou hast heard, is a miracle, why shouldst thou
not admit, as proved, the moon of Káshgar?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_63" id="fnanchor_63"></a><a href="#footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></span>

And if thou namest Moses, ‘the speaker of God,’
why shouldst thou not so much the more give this
title to Sámerí,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_64" id="fnanchor_64"></a><a href="#footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></span>
who caused a calf to speak?</p>

<p>“But if it be said that every intellect has not the
power of comprehending the sublime precepts,
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">81</span>
but that the bounty of the all-mighty God created
degrees of reason and a particular order of spirits,
so that he blessed a few of the number with superior
sagacity; and that the merciful light of lights,
by diffusion and guidance, exalted the prophets
even above these intellects. If it be so, then a
prophet is of little service to men; for he gives
instruction which they do not understand, or
which their reason does not approve. Then the
prophet will propagate his doctrine by the sword;
he says to the inferiors: ‘My words are above
your understanding, and your study will not
comprehend them.’ To the intelligent he says:
‘My faith is above the mode of reason.’ Thus,
his religion suits neither the ignorant nor the
wise. Another evil <em>attending submission to an
incomprehensible doctrine</em> is that, whatever the intellect
possesses and offers by its ingenuity, turns
to no instruction and advantage of mankind, whilst
the prophet himself has said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">‘God imposes upon a man no more than he can bear.’</p>

<p>“And whatever the understanding does not comprise
within the extent of reason, the truth of this
remains hidden; and to assent thereto is silliness;
because the doctrine of other wise men may be of
a higher value than the tradition or the book of
that prophet. Besides, if the maxim were inculcated
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
that prophets must be right, any body who
chose could set up the pretension of being one;
as silly men will always be found to follow him,
saying: ‘His reason is superior to ours, which is
not equal to such things.’ Hence have arisen
among the Muselmans and other nations so many
creeds and doctrines, as well as practices without
number.</p>

<p>“Another defect is that, when the religion of one
prophet has been adopted, and when his rule has
been followed in the knowledge and worship of
God, after a certain time another prophet arises,
who prescribes another religion to the people.
Hence they become perplexed, and know not
whether the former prophet was a liar, or whether
they ought to conclude that in each period
mankind is to alter the law according to circumstances.
But the knowledge of truth admits no
contradiction; yet there exists a great number of
contradictions in the four sacred books:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_65" id="fnanchor_65"></a><a href="#footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></span>
hence
it appears that, in the first times, the true God has
not made himself known, and that the first creed
with respect to him had been wrong; thus, in
the second book, something else is said, and in
like manner in the third and in the fourth.</p>

<p>“In the sequel it became evident to wise men,
that emancipation is to be obtained only by the
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pageno">83</span>
knowledge of truth conformably with the precepts
of the perfect prophet, the perfect lord of fame,
<dfn>Akbar</dfn>, ‘the Wise;’ the practices enjoined by him
are: renouncing and abandoning the world;
refraining from lust, sensuality, entertainment,
slaughter of what possesses life; and from appropriating
to one’s self the riches of other men;
abstaining from women, deceit, false accusation,
oppression, intimidation, foolishness, and giving
(to others) opprobrious titles. The endeavors for
the recompense of the other world, and the forms
of the true religion may be comprised in ten virtues,
namely: 1. liberality and beneficence; 2. forbearance
from bad actions and repulsion of anger
with mildness; 3. abstinence from worldly desires;
4. care of freedom from the bonds of the
worldly existence and violence, as well as accumulating
precious stores for the future real and
perpetual world; 5. piety, wisdom, and devotion,
with frequent meditations on the consequences
of actions; 6. strength of dexterous prudence
in the desire of sublime actions; 7. soft
voice, gentle words, and pleasing speeches for
every body; 8. good society with brothers, so that
their will may have the precedence to our own;
9. a perfect alienation from the creatures, and a
perfect attachment to the supreme Being; 10.
purification of the soul by the yearning after God
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">84</span>
the all-just, and the union with the merciful Lord,
in such a manner that, as long as the soul dwells
in the body, it may think itself one with him and
long to join him, until the hour of separation
from the body arrives. The best men are those
who content themselves with the least food, and
who sequestrate themselves from this perishable
world, and abstain from the enjoyments of eating,
drinking, dress, and marriage. The vilest of the
people are those who think it right to indulge the
desire of generation, the passion for wine, and banquetting
with eagerness, as if it were something
divine. As the mode which the perfect prophet
and apostle, Akbar the Wise, has prescribed to his
followers, is difficult, certainly the demons excite
the spirit of brutish passion against his regulations;
so that there are prophets who, captivated
with lust, anger, pleasures of eating and drinking,
costly garments, beautiful women, and engaged in
oppression towards the children of one race, whom
they call infidels, consider these practices not only
as legal, but even as laudable, and tend towards
them. So it happens that many learned men and
their followers, who, for the sake of the world
have chosen to obey these prophets, but in their
heart deny them, and are aware of the falsehood
of this sect, wait for an opportunity, with prudent
regard to circumstances and a favorable hour, to
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">85</span>
adopt the regulations <em>of Akbar</em>”.&mdash;Nobody in the
assembly had an answer to give to the learned philosopher,
who, after the effort which he had made,
left the hall.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_66" id="fnanchor_66"></a><a href="#footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The lord vicar of God said to his disciples, that,
it is an indispensable duty to worship God, the all-just,
and that it is necessary to praise those who are
near him; among mankind, said he, none is higher
in rank than the planets, to the station of which no
man can attain. None except God, the all-mighty,
is the wish of the godly man, that is, whatever the
godly undertakes, the object of his wish in it is
God; for instance, he takes some food, that he may
be able to perform the service of God; performs
that service, that he may not be slack and deficient
in his duties to God; desires a wife, that he may
give existence to a virtuous son, worshipper of God;
pays veneration to the lights of the stars, because
they are near God the all-just; and abandons himself
to sleep, that his soul may ascend to the upper
world. Finally, the godly man is at all times in the
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">86</span>
service and obedience of the all-just, and at no moment
is he negligent in pious practices. Moreover,
he thinks himself bound to abstain from hurting
living beings, and he respects all the creatures of
God. He does not cut grass and green trees without
necessity, nor pollute the ground wantonly, except
on a particular place; he throws neither water nor
fire upon vile spots; he blesses the stars; further
in this disposition he accustoms himself to abstinence
in speaking, eating, and sleeping; he constrains
himself to many occupations: one of them is
to close with his fingers the exterior organs; he
dwells with veneration upon the image of the lord
of fires (the sun), until he had carried this exercise
so far that, by merely covering his eyes, the great
object is present to him; then, whichever of the
illustrious and mighty personages of Hind, or Iran,
or Greece, or any other place, he wishes to see, that
person presents himself to his view, and he sees
lights, explores many ways, and makes himself
master of the temporary and the eternal. The lord
vicar of the all-just is called <dfn>Ilahí</dfn>, “divine,” by his
followers, because in all their actions the object of
their wishes is God; and the lord has received the
divine mission to establish the worship of the stars,
which are to be the Kiblah of the pious. In the ancient
books of the Hindus and Parsis, without number,
the excellence of the constellations is affirmed.</p>

<p><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">87</span>
Náin Javet gave the information that, in the reign
of the lord (Akbar) the learned assembled, and Makhdúm
ul mulk gave the decision, that in this age it is
not required to make the pilgrimage to Mecca; but
that whoever makes it deserves punishment; for this
reason; namely, because the road to Mecca by land
passes through the middle of Irak, and by sea through
Guzerat and the ports of the Farangis; by land it is
unavoidable to hear unseemly speeches from the
Kazel báshan; and on the voyage by sea to suffer
much impropriety in the transactions and communications
with the Farangis; because they have
represented upon their papers<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_67" id="fnanchor_67"></a><a href="#footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></span>
the image of Jesus
and the picture of Mary, which bear a resemblance
to idolatry.</p>

<p>His majesty Akbar said one day that he heard
from Shaikh Abdul Nabí, that one of the chief lawyers
of the Sonnites declared the taking of nine
wives to be legal, whilst other learned men denied
it, and quoted the passage of the Koran:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Take in marriage such women as please you, two, or three, or
four.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_68" id="fnanchor_68"></a><a href="#footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>
As even eighteen wives were said to be legal, then
the learned gave the decision that it may be admissible,
by the mode of <dfn>matâh</dfn>, “a temporary agreement,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_69" id="fnanchor_69"></a><a href="#footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></span>

by means of which the obtainment of women
is facilitated for a certain price; and this is
permitted pursuant to the creed of the Imám Málik.
The sect of the Shíahs assert, that a son begotten in
consequence of <dfn>matâh</dfn>, is preferable to all others.
Nakib Khan followed the footsteps of the Imám
Málik, who at last declared the matâh legal by a public
patent. The sect of the Shíáhs quote, in support
of this, the following passage of the Koran:</p>

<p class="blockquote"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
“Your women are a field for you: approach your field as you
may like.”</p>

<p class="unindent">By which they pretend to show that any mode of
coition is permitted.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_70" id="fnanchor_70"></a><a href="#footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></span>
Náin Javet said that, when the
era of the Muselmans was fixed, the people had a
bad opinion of the companions of the prophet, and
wise men called all the laws “prisons,” and declared
the centre of faith rests upon reason. Nobody disputed
with them. Then arrived learned Farangis,
and argued in their speeches. <span class="title">Shaikh</span> Bhavan, so
was called a learned Brahman from the country of Dekan,
having conceived hatred towards his relations,
became a Muselman, and obtained this name:
he had the fourth Véda in his possession, and interpreted
some precepts of this book, which contains
many beauties, and a sentence like that of the Koran:
“There is but one God;” and it was also stated
therein, that whoever does not make this confession
will not obtain salvation. In another place it was
said that to eat cow’s flesh was, under certain conditions,
allowable; and elsewhere it was ordained to
bury, and not to burn, a corpse. Thus, the beforesaid
Shaikh was triumphant over the Brahmans.
But Náin Javet related that he has requested him to
interpret this passage; when he had translated it, its
meaning was completely contrary and opposed to
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">90</span>
the sentence: “There is but one God,” and the
restriction to eat cow’s flesh also was contrary to the
custom of the Muselmans; and concerning the burying
of the dead he gave a different account from that
which is lawful by the faith of the Muselmans. His
Majesty (Akbar), with all those present, laughed at
the Brahman, and said: “Look at these Muselmans
and Hindus, who among many conflicting
arguments did not think to ask what was the
meaning of the passages in question, and have
praised me exceedingly.”</p>

<p>Mír Sáíd Sherif Amely came to the place of Daibálpúr,
and waited on his Majesty (Akbar), who was
then taking part in a public dispute between a number
of young men with some theologians, about Mahmúd,
and he reduced them to silence. The Emperor
conferred also many favors upon the said Mir, and the
controversy in religion went so far that even doctors
in law were accused of infidelity; learned men and
Sufies declared in the celestial court (Akbar’s), that
wise and capable men existed in all religions: where
then is the superiority and preponderance? More
than one thousand years have not elapsed since this
faith was established.</p>

<p>In like manner, a number of children were put in
a place called <span class="place">Gangmahel</span>, where every thing necessary
was furnished to them; but none could articulate
a letter; having remained there to their fourteenth
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">91</span>
year, they were found to be dumb; which made
it evident, that letters and language are not natural
to man, that is, cannot be used unless they have
been acquired by instruction, and it is then only
that the use of conversation becomes possible.
From this the conclusion was drawn, that the world
is very ancient, and language of a long date, whence
the Brahmans derive arguments founded upon reason
and testimony for the truth of their religion and
the futility of others.</p>

<p>The crown of the pious Shaikh Táj-ed-din, the son
of Shaikh Zakríá Jondehení Dahluví, explained the
exterior rites of the mystic doctrine; the system of
the unity of the real being; and the precepts of the
religion of Pharâoh, which is the <dfn>Feśus ul hikem</dfn>, the
“bezels of philosophers,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_71" id="fnanchor_71"></a><a href="#footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></span>
and the superiority of
hope over fear. His Majesty Akbar liked the mode
in which the Kings of Ajem performed worship; the
Sufis, acknowledging holy personages as representing
the Khalífs of the age, used to prostrate themselves
before them, touching the ground with their
foreheads; this was intended to mark the secret
meaning that the angels had once adored Adam.
The truth is, that the wise are the terrestrial angels,
who worship an holy personage as a <dfn>Khalífah</dfn>, “vicar,”
of God; and for having attained to this dignity,
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pageno">92</span>
they venerate him under a similar character,
and call him also their <span class="title">Kabâh</span> and <span class="title">Kiblah</span>: because
the heart of a just man is the heart of the all-just
God, and it is to its door that they turn in the worship
of God; in that sense Yâkúb and his sons prostrated
themselves before Yúsef.</p>

<p>Shaikh Yâkúb, a grammarian of Kashmir, who
was a spiritual guide of the age, related, as from <cite>Aín
alkasa Hamdání</cite>, that Muhammed is the manifest
name of a guide, and Iblis the manifest name of a
seducer. Mulla Muhammed Yzedí blamed the three
khalifs, and reviled the companions of the prophet
and their followers; he seduced people to the faith
of Shíâhs, and, having brought forth chapters of the
Gospel, he drew from them a proof of the third
person of the Trinity as being true, and confirmed
the religion of the Naśaránains.</p>

<p>As his Majesty (Akbar) showed himself a friend of
all men, he gave orders to the Nawab, the wise
<span class="person">Shaikh Abu ’l Faźil</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_72" id="fnanchor_72"></a><a href="#footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></span>
who frequently witnessed the
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pageno">93</span>
prodigious deeds of the emperor, to interpret several
<em>foreign works</em>, and instead of the common sentence,
“<span class="title">Bismilla</span>,” etc., he adopted another, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Thy name is a fortress, and thou art its foundation,</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou art holy, and there is no God but God.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The Rájah Birber conceived in his mind that the
sun is an object all comprehensive; that he causes
the ripening of the grain, of the sown fields, of the
fruits, and of all vegetables; and gives splendor and
life; likewise, fire and water, and stones and trees,
all are manifestations of God; he gave the mark on
the forehead and the zunar. The learned brought
it nearly to certainty that the sun, the great, the
exalted luminary, is the benefactor of the world,
and the protector of monarchs. The Yezdánian said,
that the sun is the world of spirits, the self-existent
being; and the sun of the world of bodies is a luminary
(a soul)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_73" id="fnanchor_73"></a><a href="#footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></span>
which is the Khalifah, “the vicar,”
of God. A sect of the fire-worshippers stated also
that the learned entertain conflicting opinions about
the existence of spirits, of unity, and the self-existing
being; and other sects denied this; but no denial is
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pageno">94</span>
possible about the existence, the splendor, and the
beneficence of the sun. His Majesty, Akbar, as he
was ordered by God, used to read prayers, containing
the praise of the sun, in the Persian, Hindi,
Turkish, and Arabic languages, among which all
was one prayer which is proper to the Hindus, and
which they sing at midnight and at sun-rise. Besides,
the emperor forbade his subjects to kill cows
and to eat their flesh because medical men have
declared that cow’s flesh causes itch, dry scab, leprosy,
elephantiasis, and the like diseases, and is
difficult to digest. The Hindus say also that, as
many advantages are derived from the cow, it is not
right to kill it. The Yezdánian maintained that it is
tyranny to kill harmless animals, and a tyrant is an
enemy of God, the Almighty. But the learned of the
time showed in the book <cite>Serat´ ul mustakím</cite>, “the
right road,” composed by the Imám <span class="person">Majeddin Muhammed</span>,
son of <span class="person">Yàkub</span>, son of <span class="person">Muhammed</span>, <span class="person">Fírózábádí</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_74" id="fnanchor_74"></a><a href="#footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></span>
that what is known</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The most excellent meat of both worlds is flesh.”</p>

<p>This has not been firmly established, and in the
subject of the excellence of <dfn>hersiah</dfn>, a kind of pottage,
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">95</span>
nothing appeared, nor on the subject of the virtues
of the white cock;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_75" id="fnanchor_75"></a><a href="#footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></span>
and on the subject of bastards it
is known:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The illegitimate son has no access to paradise.”</p>

<p class="unindent">This was not firmly established, and is futile. His Majesty,
the khalífah of the all-just, proclaimed himself
the joyous tidings, that cows ought not to be killed.</p>

<p>In like manner, the fire-worshippers, who had
come from the town of Nóusarí, situated in the
district of Gujerát, asserted the truth of the religion
of Zoroaster, and the great reverence and worship
due to fire. The emperor called them to his presence,
and was pleased to take information about
the way and lustre of their wise men. He also called
from Persia a follower of Zardusht, named Ardeshir,
to whom he sent money; he delivered the
sacred fire with care to the wise Shaikh Abu ’l Faźil,
and established that it should be preserved in
the interior apartment by night and day, perpetual
henceforth, according to the rule of the Mobeds, and
to the manner which was always practised in the
fire-temples of the Kings of Ajem, because the <dfn>Ití set</dfn>
was among the sentences of the Lord, and light from
among the lights of the great Ized. He invited likewise
the fire-worshippers from Kirman to his presence,
and questioned them about the subtilties of
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">96</span>
Zardusht’s religion; and he wrote letters to Azer-Káivan,
who was a chief of the Yezdáníán and Abádáníán,
and invited him to India; Azer-Káivan
begged to be excused from coming, but sent a book
of his own composition in praise of the self-existing
being, of reason, the soul, the heavens, the stars, and
the elements; as well as a word of advice to the King;
all this contained in fourteen sections: every first
line of each was in Persian <span class="trans">pure derí</span>; when read
invertedly, it was Arabic; when turned about,
Turkish; and when this was read in reversed order,
it became Hindí. The Nawab, the wise Shaikh Abu
’l Fazil placed a full confidence in Azer Káivan; he
called the inhabitants of Ajem and Arabia “infestors
of roads,” and the people of Islám “accursed.”
The wise Shaikh Abu ’l Fazil said in Fatah púr to
Abd ul Káder Bedávaní: “I have to complain of the
authors of books for two reasons: the first is,
that they have not explicitly enough written the
account of ancient prophets, similar to that of
their own prophet; the second is, that nothing
remained of the industrious men whose name
is not mentioned in the <cite>Tazkeret-ul-awlía</cite>, ‘the
Story of the Saints,’<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_76" id="fnanchor_76"></a><a href="#footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></span>
and the <dfn>Nafhát alúns</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_77" id="fnanchor_77"></a><a href="#footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></span>
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pageno">97</span>
‘the fragrant Gales of Mankind,’ and the like;
and the family of the prophet, what was their
guilt that their names were not admitted into
them?” Abd ul Káder gave no satisfactory
answer. Ghází Khán Baddakshi, who had not his
equal in logical science, treated explicitly and laboriously
in sections of the just Imám (Alí), and established
by investigation his superior merit in other
treatises; and other learned men exercised their
sagacity upon this subject.</p>

<p>In the month Rajeb of the year of the Hejira 987
(A. D. 1579), the Emperor Akbar was ordered (by
Heaven) to fix the sentence: “There is but one God,
and Akbar is his Khalifah,” to be used. If the
people really wished it, they might adopt this faith;
and his Majesty declared, that this religion ought to
be established by choice, and not by violence. In
this manner, a number of men, who were more pious
or wise than those of their times, chose this creed
according to their conscience. The command came
from God, that the attachment to the cause of the
Lord God and to one’s master has four degrees,
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pageno">98</span>
which are: sacrifice of property, life, reputation, and
religion. The command of the <dfn>Ilahi</dfn>, “divine,” faith
means that, in case of an indispensable conflict, if one
does not sacrifice all he possesses, he must renounce
these four degrees. Further, it is the divine command,
that one may relinquish something of the four
degrees, but never make an abandonment of his God.</p>

<p>The Emperor further said, that one thousand
years have elapsed since the beginning of Muhammed’s
mission, and that this was the extent of the
duration of this religion, now arrived at its term.</p>

<p>Another of his ordinances abolished absolutely
the obligation of bathing after pollution <em>by spermatic
emission</em>. The sages said that the most exquisite and
best part of a man is <dfn>maní</dfn>, “sperm,” and that the
seed of creation is pure. What sense is there that,
after the common natural secretions bathing be not
required, whilst the release of a quantity of delicate
matter is subject to an entire ablution? Yet it is suitable
to bathe before indulging sexual propensity.</p>

<p>It is equally absurd to prepare food for the spirit
of a corpse, which then belongs to minerals: what
sense is there in it? Yet the birth-day of a person
is justly made a great festival, and called “the banquet
of life.” Moreover, when one’s soul has attained
the full knowledge of the primitive cause, and
has left its mortal garment, this day also is devoted
to rejoicing, and named “the day of union.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pageno">99</span>
On account of the difference between the era of
the Hindus and that of the Hejira used by the
Arabs, the Emperor introduced a new one, beginning
from the first year of the reign of Hamáyún,
which is 963 of the Hejira (A. D. 1555-6); the
names of the months were those used by the Kings
of Ajem; and fourteen festivals in the year instituted,
coinciding with those of Zardusht, were
named “the years and days of <span class="person">Ilahí</span>.” This arrangement
was established by <span class="person">Hakím Sháh Fattah
ulla Shírází</span>. On account of hearing so many disputes
of the learned in the midst of the multitude,
the custom of reading the comments on the Koran
and the science of religion and law, were laid aside,
and in their place astronomy, physic, arithmetic,
mysticism, poetry, and chronology became current.
The people of Ajem used to repeat frequently
these verses:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“By living upon milk of camels and upon lizards,</div>
  <div class="i2">The Arabians raised their fortune;</div>
  <div class="i2">So that they now covet Ajem:</div>
  <div class="i2">Fie upon thee, O revolving world, fie!”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Khaja abd ul látíf,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_78" id="fnanchor_78"></a><a href="#footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></span>
who was one of the distinguished
personages of Maverah ul naher, gifted with
the talent of subtile distinctions, raised doubts upon
the truth of the saying:</p>

<p class="blockquote"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">100</span>
‘The neck of the lord Muhammed is similar to the neck of an idol.’</p>

<p>If that prevailed, then idolatry would be laudable.
In like manner, the tradition about the she-camel
straying far off,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_79" id="fnanchor_79"></a><a href="#footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></span>
which is published in the <cite>Sír</cite>,
“acts and deeds;” then the assault upon the caravan
of the Koraish, in the beginning of the Hejira;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_80" id="fnanchor_80"></a><a href="#footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></span>
also demanding nine wives,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_81" id="fnanchor_81"></a><a href="#footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></span>
and the interdiction of
women from husbands according to the pleasure of
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">101</span>
the prophet, and this taking place;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_82" id="fnanchor_82"></a><a href="#footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></span>
the companions
giving up their body; which is to be known
by reading the book <cite>Sír</cite>; further, the appointment
of the three first khalifs;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_83" id="fnanchor_83"></a><a href="#footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></span>

the war of Safín;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_85" id="fnanchor_85"></a><a href="#footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></span>
the victory of the Shiâhs; and the
defeat of the Sonnites: <em>all these topics are subject to
reflection</em>.</p>

<p>At a convivial meeting on the new-year’s festival,
a Kási and a Mufti were inclined to drink cups of
wine. Shaik Abu ’l Fazil, as a counterpart to the
explanation of the verse of the Koran, called “the
throne,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_86" id="fnanchor_86"></a><a href="#footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></span>
composed a sermon in two parts. He
also translated the Mahábharat, which is the history
of the wars of the ancient Hindu chiefs. Some
learned men denied absolutely the affair of Muhammed’s
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">102</span>
marriage night with <span class="title">Sidíkáh</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_87" id="fnanchor_87"></a><a href="#footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></span>
and blamed the
deed of David concerning Uriah’s wife.</p>

<p>When the Sultán Khajah, who was one of the
Ilahian, was about to leave this world, he said to the
emperor: “Let not your Majesty bury me as if I had
been an adorer of Divs.” On that account he was
placed in a tomb with lamps, like a person of distinction,
and a lattice was left towards the great
majestic luminary, the splendor of which purifies
from of all sins. Further, orders were issued that,
in imitation of the kings of Ajem, low people may be
prevented from reading the books of the wise, and
from the pursuit of sciences. By other ordinances,
the affairs of the Hindus were to be decided by
learned Brahmans, and those of Muselmans by their
own Káśis. Likewise the followers of other religions
and persuasions received orders, that the head
of a corpse may be laid in a tomb towards the east,
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
and its feet towards the west; and that persons,
even in their sleep, may dispose themselves in that
direction. It was further ordained, that the Ilahian
may not apply to any other sciences of the
Arabs but to astronomy, arithmetic, physic, and
philosophy, and not spend their life-time in the
pursuit of what is not reasonable. The interdiction
of slaying cows was confirmed. It was also
regulated, that a Hindu woman is not to be prevented
from burning with her dead husband, but
that the sacrifice ought to take place without violence
used towards, or abhorrence shewn by, the
widow. Another regulation was that, whoever
eats with one whose profession is the slaughter of
animals, should have his hand cut off; but only a
finger, if he belong to the people of his house.</p>

<p>Again, a woman who is going about in narrow
streets or in market-places, without having at that
time her face veiled, ought not to be approached by
her husband; and a woman of improper conduct,
who quarrels with her husband, ought to be sent to
the place of prostitutes, whose business it is to offer
themselves for sale. In addition to this, in times of
distressing famine, a father and a mother may happen
to sell their children under age; when they find
themselves in better circumstances, they must be
allowed, by giving money, to rescue their offspring
from the bonds of servitude. Moreover, a Hindu
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">104</span>
who, in his infancy, without his will, has been made
a Muselman, if later he chooses to return to the faith
of his fathers, is at liberty to do so, and is not to be
prevented from it; also every person is permitted
to profess whatever religion he chooses, and to pass,
whenever he likes, from one religion to another.
But if a Hindu woman, having fallen in love with a
Muselman, wishes to adopt his religion, she can be
taken by force and delivered up to her family. And
likewise a Muselman woman, if she has fallen in
love with an Hindu, and wishes to adopt his faith, is
prevented from it, and not admitted in his caste.
Finally, the erection of a temple of idols, of a church,
of a fire-temple, and a sepulchral vault, ought not to
be impeded, nor the building of a mosque for the
Muselmans.</p>

<p>Sader Jehan adopted the Ilahi religion. Acbar
called the harmless animals the beasts of peace, and
showed abhorrence to their slaughter. He mixed
the best and purest part of every religion for the
formation of his own faith. Mulla Tersún Badakhshi,
who was a Muselman of the Hanifa creed, informed
me, in the Hejira 1058 (A. D. 1648-9),
that one day he went on a pilgrimage to visit the
sepulchre of Akbar, the inhabitant of heaven; there,
one of his friends, having hurt his foot in climbing
up the holy tomb, set about reviling the khalifah of
God. The companions said: “If the blessed Emperor,
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pageno">105</span>
now in heaven, have any power, that man
will certainly come to some misfortune.” Soon
after, indeed, he broke a toe of his foot by a stone
which had fallen down from a crevice of the
wall. In one of Akbar’s works we find, that it is
indispensable to worship God, the all-just, and
necessary to praise the beings near him; that none
of mankind rise to the rank of stars, as men are not
equal to the dignity of celestial luminaries. The
Emperor inculcated on his followers, that a godly
man ought to know no other object of his wishes
but God, the Almighty; that is, whatever business
the godly undertakes, his wish in that business ought
to tend towards God.</p>

 <span class="place">Fedak</span>, according to Abulfeda (<abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 133. 273), is a castle near the town
of <span class="place">Khaibar</span>; this is a place fertile in palm-trees in the Arabian province
of <span class="place">Hejaz</span>, four days’ journey distant from Mecca. It was given to Muhammed
by the faithful, under the name of alms. After the prophet’s
death, Fátima claimed it as a patrimony: but Abubekr refused it to
her, setting forth the above mentioned saying of the prophet. Abulfeda,
whom I follow, gives it as follows:</p>

<p class="footnote"><span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">نحن معاشر الانبیاء لانورث ماتر کناہ صدقة</span></p>

<p class="footnote">The words <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">لانورث</span> are not in the quotation of the Dabistán, <abbr title="edition">edit.</abbr> of
Calcutta, nor in the manuscript of Oude. Thus was Fedak taken from

remained until Omar declared it again to belong to alms, and assigned
the usufruct of it to the Alides. But <span class="person">Mamun</span>, the seventh khalif of the

 Muhammed had scarcely expired, when a vehement contest about the
succession to his dignity arose between the <dfn>Mohajirin</dfn>, “the emigrants
from Mecca with the prophet,” and the <dfn>Ansar</dfn>, “the protectors (see
<a href="#footnote_21">note</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27): both claimed the right of nomination. Abubekr was proclaimed
by both. To crush the resistance of Alí, who was the legitimate
competitor, Omar, sent by Abu-bekr, burnt the gate, and was about to
set on fire the house of Alí&mdash;scarcely restrained from the act by the
reproach of Fátima, Muhammed’s daughter and Ali’s wife, who from
that moment till her death never spoke to any of the enemies of her husband.
The prophet, according to authentic traditions, said: “Whoever
gives offence to Fatimah gives offence to me; and whoever offends me,
offends God.”</p>

 Muhammed, son of Ismáil al Jisfi, called <span class="title">Bochárí</span>, from his native
town in Mazinderan, lived from the year of the Hejira 194 to 256 (A. D.
809-869). He is chiefly celebrated by a work composed, as he says himself,
at the prophet’s tomb at Madína, from six hundred thousand traditions,
and called <dfn>Masnad es sahih</dfn>, the sincere (just) Masnad. “Masnad”
signifies a collection of traditions, each of which is accompanied
with the name of the traditionist by whom it was handed down.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_40" id="footnote_40"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_40"><span class="muchsmaller">[40]</span></a>
 This happened in the battle of Ohod (so is called a mountain half an
hour’s distance from Madína, on the route of Mecca). Muhammed fought
with seven hundred men against more than three thousand Koreish from
Mecca, in the third year of the Hejira (A. D. 624). Otba, the son of Vaccasi,
and brother of Sâd, who fought on the prophet’s side, hit him with
a stone, so as to knock out four incisors of his inferior jaw.</p>

a writer of revelations, and who, because he had apostatised from Islamism,
would have been put to death by the prophet, after the taking of

for him.</p>

 This relates to an expedition which Muhammed undertook, in the
ninth year of the Hejira (A. D. 630), towards <span class="place">Tabúk</span>, a place situated
about half-way between <span class="place">Madína</span> and <span class="place">Damascus</span>, beyond the limits of
Arabia; it was in the midst of the summer heats, at a time of great
drought and scarcity; besides the fruits were then just ripe, and the
people had much rather have remained to gather them. But the first
cause of discontent was the exaction of a tribute for covering the expense
of the expedition. Abubekr, Omar, Osman, Alí, Talha, Abder rahmen,
contributed largely to it; others declined their pecuniary and personal
aid; three of the <dfn>anśars</dfn>, friends above alluded to (see <a href="#Page_27"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27</a>), were permitted
to remain. Alí staid at Madína as lieutenant of the prophet, who
moved with an army of thirty thousand men to the frontiers of Syria,
which were defended by an equal force of Greeks. He encamped during
twenty days near Tabúk, and then thought it necessary to retreat.</p>

 If I am not mistaken, allusion is here made to <span class="person">Zeinah</span> (Zenobia), the
wife of Zaid. Muhammed, having gone one day to the house of the latter,
who was not at home, found Zeinah in a dress which permitted him to
remark her beauties, with which he was so smitten, that he could not refrain
from an exclamation betraying his sensation. Zeinah did not fail to
apprise her husband. Zeid then thought he could not do less than to
place his wife by a divorce at the disposition of his master and benefactor,
whose slave he had once been, and by whom he was not only affranchised,
but adopted as a son. On that very account, Muhammed was
prevented by law from marrying Zeinah; but he procured to himself an
authorization from heaven, in a verse of the Koran (<abbr title="chapter 33 verse">chap. XXXIII. v.</abbr> 36),
and after the term of Zeinah’s divorce, took to wife the object of his
desires, at the latter end of the fifth year of the Hejira (A. D. 626).</p>

During the contest between Alí and Moaviah, the armies of both
chiefs were in the year of the Hejira 37 (A. D. 657) encamped opposite
to each other in a plain on the banks of the Euphrates, called by the
Greeks <span class="title">Barbelissos</span> or <span class="title">Barabrissos</span>, and by the Arabs <span class="title">Safin</span>; and in ninety
engagements, which took place between them in a hundred and ten
days, on the side of Moaviah fell forty-five thousand, and on that of Ali
twenty-five thousand men. In the night which preceded the decisive day
of Safin, Ali is said to have killed with his own hand four hundred enemies.&mdash;(<cite>Abulfeda</cite>,

 Muhammed, according to his traditions, was born in the twentieth
year of Nushirvan’s reign, which, as this king began to reign A. D. 531,
would be in 551. This does not agree with the date of the prophet’s
death in 632, at the age of sixty-three years, about which the best historians
are unanimous. For the same reason, the date of his birth, as
stated by Silvestre de Sacy, on the 20th April, 571, cannot be true.
According to Weisi, Muhammed was born in the thirty-eighth year of
Nushirvan’s reign, on the 1st of April, 569, which was a Monday, and it
was on a Monday he was born and died (see <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gemäldesaal <abbr title="Moslimischer">Mosl.</abbr>, Herrsher

 Amrál Kais, son of Hajr, king of the Arabs of the tribe of <span class="title">Kendah</span>,
according to Herbelot, of <span class="title">Asad</span>, was, according to Sale, one of the greatest
poets before Muhammedism, and one of the seven, whose compositions
were suspended upon silken stuff in golden letters in the temple of
Mecca, and therefore called <dfn>moallakat</dfn>, “suspended.” His poems,
translated by Sir W. Jones (<abbr title="volume Ten">vol. X.</abbr> of his Works), are amatory, and have
nothing of religion which Muhammed could borrow. Amrálkaís was one
of the adversaries of the prophet, and wrote satires and invectives against
him, which were answered by <span class="person">Labíd</span>, another of the seven poets, but
who ranged himself on the side of Muhammed. The Arabian prophet
certainly took many tenets and customs from former times and religions:
thus he confirmed the holiness of the temple of Mecca and its environs,
which were held in veneration long before him; thus he adopted from
Judaism several laws relating to marriages, divorces, etc., etc.</p>

 As the Arabians descend from Ismail, the brother of Isaak, they
take to themselves the blessing which God, in Genesis (<abbr title="seventeen">XVII.</abbr> 20), pronounced
upon him and his posterity; and in the twelve princes who,
according to the same verse, were to issue from him, they see their twelve
Imáms, Alí and the rest (see <abbr title="volume Two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 367). They believe also that the
prophet, who, as God announced to Moses in the Pentateuch (Deuteronomy,
<abbr title="eighteen">XVIII.</abbr> 18), would rise from the Ismailites, was Muhammed. According
to Abul Firaj (<cite>Specimen <abbr title="Historiæ Arabum">Hist. Arab.</abbr></cite>, 14.17), the Muhammedans
find in a passage of the Pentateuch (<abbr title="Deuteronomy Thirty-three">Deuter., XXXIII.</abbr> 2) indicated the
descent of the law to Moses upon mount Sinai; that of the Gospel to
Jesus upon mount Sair; and that of the Koran to Muhammed upon
mount Pharan, near Mecca. Further, in Psalm <abbr title="Fifty verse">L. v.</abbr> 2. they imagine
that in the words: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Manifestavit Deus e Sione coronam laudatam, <em>actilan
mahmudan</em>,”</span> by <dfn>actilan</dfn>, “crown,” is to be understood “kingdom,”
and by <dfn>mahmudan</dfn>, “praised,” the very name of Muhammed.
But this passage is translated in our Bible: “Out of Sion hath God
appeared in perfect beauty.” They find also passages applicable to
their prophet in Isaiah <abbr title="Twenty-two">XXII.</abbr> 6. 7. 9: <abbr title="Forty-two">XLII.</abbr> 1. 7. 16. 17.; and the whole
chapter <abbr title="sixty-three">LXIII.</abbr> 1. 6. etc.: moreover in Habacuc, <abbr title="Three">III</abbr>. 3. etc. Besides, the
town of Medina, being inhabited by a tribe of conquered Jews, who were
expecting a promised Messiah, Muhammed presented himself as one for
all nations; and the credulous easily confounded him who was expected
by the Jews with the upstart Arabian prophet.</p>

 The Moslims have a Gospel in Arabic, attributed to Saint Barnabas,
in which, it is said, they have inserted the very name of their prophet
<span class="title">Muhammed</span>, <span class="title">Ahmed</span>, <span class="title">Mahmud</span>, as being the translation of the Greek
word περικλυτος, periclytos, “famous, illustrious,” which they have
substituted for παρακλητος, paraclètos, “comforter, called upon, <dfn>advocatus</dfn>;”
which is found in St. John’s Gospel, XIV. 26; XV. 26; XVI. 7.;
and by which is designated Jesus, or the Holy Ghost (see Sale’s <cite>Koran</cite>,
<abbr title="Preliminary Discussion, page">Prel. Disc., p.</abbr> 98). The interpretation of the word <dfn>periclytos</dfn> might
also have found place in the Arabian translation of the Bible, made by
Werka, the cousin of Muhammed’s first wife. Whatever it be, we read in
<abbr title="chapter sixty-one verse">chap. LXI. v.</abbr> 6. of the Koran: “And when Jesus, the son of Mary, said:
‘O children of Israel, verily I am the apostle of God, sent unto you,
confirming the law which was delivered before me, and bringing
good tidings of an apostle who shall come after me, and whose name
shall be <span class="title">Ahmed</span>.’”</p>

 This miracle has perhaps no other foundation but the atmospheric
phenomena of a double moon which was seen in Mecca, four or five years
before the Hejira. Some ascribed it to Muhammed on the infidels demanding
a sign of him; the moon then appeared cloven in two; one part
vanishing and the other remaining: it was affirmed that the mount Hara
was seen interposing between the two sections. To this the believers
refer chapter <abbr title="fifty-four">LIV</abbr> of the Koran, entitled <cite>the moon</cite>, which begins by these
words: “The hour approacheth, and the moon hath been split asunder.’
The most intelligent expounders understand in the first word the hour
of judgment; others think, that in the rest the preter tense is used, in the
prophetic style, for the future; and that the passage should be thus
rendered: “The moon shall be split asunder:” for this, they say, is to
happen at the resurrection.&mdash;(See Sale’s <cite>Koran</cite>, <abbr title="volume Two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 405). In the
subsequent section, “upon the interpretation of the prophet’s miracle,”
this subject is particularly treated.</p>

whom the Muhammedans describe as the cousin of Moses. He is frequently
alluded to by the poets and moralists, not only as being extremely
handsome, but as possessed of immense wealth, acquired by his
skill in chemistry, and the discovery of the philosopher’s stone; whilst
his avarice is represented as so remarkable, that his name is proverbially
applied to all misers. They add, that it was on account of his
refusal to pay Moses a tithe of his possessions for the public use, that
the earth opened and swallowed him up.”</p>

 Abu ’l Fazil, the wise minister of Akbar, is generally known by his
work entitled <cite>Ayín Akbarí</cite>, “the Institutes of the Emperor Akbar,”
translated from the original Persian, by Francis Gladwin, in two volumes.
This work contains the best statistical account hitherto given respecting
India of those times. Abu ’l Fazil was the first Muhammedan who bestowed
attention upon the history and religion of the Hindus, and drew
his information regarding them from their own books. It was by him, or
under his eyes, that the Mahabharat was translated from Sanskrit into
Persian. The tolerance and liberality of the Emperor Akbar towards all
religions, and his attempt to establish a new creed, are generally ascribed
to the influence of his enlightened minister, who paid it with his life:
for Jehangir, Akbar’s fanatic son, hired assassins who murdered the excellent
man, near Orcha, in the district of Narwar, on his return from the
Dekan, during the life of Akbar, who, except his utmost indignation,
had no punishment to inflict upon the heir-apparent of his empire.</p>

the tribe of the Mostalek, in the sixth year of the Hejira (A. D. 627).
During the night-march, according to her own statement, she alighted
from her camel, in order to search for a valuable necklace which she had
dropped. On account of her light weight, her absence was not perceived
by the drivers, who went on and left her alone on the road. There,
having laid down and fallen asleep, she was the next morning found by
Safwan Ebn al Moattel, and brought, at noon, on his own camel to Muhammed’s
next resting-place. This occurrence raised suspicions respecting
Ayesha’s virtue; Muhammed found necessary to inveigh against slander in
the Koran (chap. XXIV), and to punish the free-speakers as slanderers:
but he could not silence the severe reflections of some respectable men,
among whom was Alí.&mdash;(<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hammer’s Gemäldesaal, <abbr title="erster">I<sup>ter</sup></abbr> Band. Sexte</cite>,

inhabitants of Mecca sent 950 men to succour the caravan: this force

good pleasure? He knoweth that which is past, and that which is to

passed upon the occurrence related in the preceding note (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 100 <a href="#footnote_79">note 1</a>);
not satisfied with having discarded him more than twenty-three years from
the khalifat, she led in person a strong army against him, to wrest it from
his hands; but was taken in battle, generously treated, and sent to
Medina, where she died in the year of the Hejira 58 (A. D. 677), having
attained the prophet’s age of sixty-three years.</p>

and the philosophers said, that the Almighty
Author created the celestial bodies and the stars in
such a manner that, from their movements, effects
may be manifested in the nether world, that is to
say, the events below are subject to their motions,
and every constellation, and every degree of altitude
has its particular nature; which being known by
experience, and information having been collected
about the qualities of the degrees, the celestial
signs, and their influences, it is in this manner evident
that they are near the all-just; and that the
house of prayer, the Kâbah of truth, and the Kiblah
of conviction is heaven. The wise men believe,
that every master of fame worshipped one of the
stars: thus Moses worshipped Saturn, as Saturday
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pageno">107</span>
is holy to the Jews, and Moses vanquished the magicians
and enchanters who are subservient to Saturn;
Jesus worshipped the sun, on which account Sunday
was sanctified by him, and finally his soul united
with the sun; Muhammed worshipped Venus, wherefore
he fixed upon Friday as a sacred day: as he
would not reveal this meaning to the common people,
he kept it secret; but it is evident from the
prophet’s customs that he held Venus in great veneration;
one of these was his passion for perfumes
and the like.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_90" id="fnanchor_90"></a><a href="#footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></span>
We find in the histories of the Persians,
that Ferhósh was a king in the time of Abád,
and had poets without number about him; out of
them all he chose seven; each of them, on one day
of the week, recited his verses to the king. On
Sunday, which was consecrated to the great luminary,
the monarch used to go to the <span class="place">Kermábah</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_91" id="fnanchor_91"></a><a href="#footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></span>, and
on his return from thence, having approached the
august image of the great fire, and there performed
his worship, he betook himself to his palace. The
chief of the speech-adoring bards, called Shedósh,
came then into the royal presence. As the King
professed the religion of the Yezdáníán, who never
hurt an harmless animal, they brought, on this day
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pageno">108</span>
sacred to the sun, <dfn>Sirdín</dfn>, that is “rice,” and <dfn>Perdín</dfn>,
called in Hindostan <span class="trans">pahatí</span>, before the King, and peas
in the shell, which were then stript of their integuments.
The King asked Shedósh: “For whom
is this food?” The poet answered: “For the
friend who, for the sake of retirement, is naked
from head to foot.” The monarch, being pleased
with this answer, filled the poet’s mouth with precious
pearls of the purest water. The Queen, named
Shuker, averting her heart from the King her husband,
attached it passionately to the sweet composer
of melodious speeches. When night came on, Shuker,
believing that the King slept, went out by
stealth. The King too followed her steps. When
Shuker arrived at the house of Shedósh, many
words occurred between them. Then the poet said
to her: “A woman fears nobody; on that account
she ought to be feared. Thou hast left Ferhosh,
the King, and wilt devote thy affections to
one like me!” Upon these words, the woman
returned home without hope, and Shedosh turned
his face to the image of the sun. But his looks fell
upon one of the maids who were adorers of the sun,
and desired her to converse with him; the maid,
indignant at such a proposal, having approached
the image of the sun, said: “I am thy worshipper;
and this is not the time for associating with men:
this poet of the King addressed to me an improper
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pageno">109</span>
speech.” When Shidósh came to the image of
the sun, he found himself afflicted with a malady,
and returned ashamed. Afterwards he went to the
King, who, having seen him the night before in
company with Shuker, said: “Shidósh, if thou
speakest not the truth, thou shalt be put to
death: what didst thou mean by saying that a
woman fears nobody?” Shidosh replied:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“A woman is a king; her strength is that of an ocean;</div>
  <div class="i0">It opens its passage, and has fear of nobody.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The King was pleased with this speech, and bestowed
Shuker on him as a gift; whatever excuses
Shidosh offered, the sovereign did not listen to
them; wherefore the poet brought the king’s wife
to his house. But, from disease, his flesh began to
diminish, and he was so far reduced as to be unable
to leave his house. Thus it was, until the son
of the king came to visit his father, and requested
to see the royal poets. The King, having convoked
six of them, ordered that Shidosh should recite his
verses sitting behind a curtian. Shidosh, having
heard this order, demanded at the very moment
that a fire should be kindled, and in the midst an
iron chain adjusted to suspend a seat above the
flames. He resolved to himself from thence to address
his praises to the majesty of the great fire, the
sun; if he received them with favor, so much the
better; if not, to throw himself into the fire, and so
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pageno">110</span>
to obtain his due. He then got upon the seat, and
began to chaunt the verses which he had composed
in honor of the sun: at this very time his leprosy
disappeared. But, before he had ended his poem,
his followers thought the great luminary would not
grant his wish; and the poet, from fear of his life,
would not throw himself into the fire; therefore,
pulling the chair by means of the chain, they precipitated
it into the flames. But after falling, he felt the
fire had no effect upon him, and although dejected,
remaining in his seat, he terminated his praise; then
coming forth, he approached the King, and recited
the verses which he had composed for the occasion;
he subjoined: “O King, I have not been guilty of
any vile deed on this occasion; but on the same
day, at the time when the women approach the
image of the sun, I also went there, and the guards
did not know me. But the rebellious spirit had
his play with me, so that, supposing a virtuous
woman I beheld to be unmarried, I spoke improper
words to her; on that account I was punished;
but at the same time I held Shuker as a
mother.”</p>

<p>Hóshang, the King, in the work <cite>Bahín ferah</cite>, “the
highest dignity,” which is written to inculcate
the duties towards the sanctity of the stars, states
great miracles of every luminary. We read likewise,
in the Mahábharat, that the Rája Jedeshter
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pageno">111</span>
(Yudhishthira)<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_92" id="fnanchor_92"></a><a href="#footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></span>
attained the fulfilment of his wishes
by worshipping the sun. As the Mahábharat is all
symbolic, we also find there that the sun, having
appeared to him in the form of a man, announced to
him: “I am pleased with thee; I will provide thee
with food during twelve years, then for the space
of thirteen years thou wilt obtain a wonderful
empire.” And the sun gave him a kettle, saying:
“The property of this kettle is, that every day all
sort of food in such quantity as thou wishest,
comes forth from it, under the condition that
thou first distributest it among Brahmans and
Fakirs, and then among thy valiant brothers,
the Kshatriyas.” Herodetes, the author of the
history of the Yúnán (Greeks), stated that in a
town of Rúmí there was in a temple an idol in the
shape of Iskalápíús, which was known under the
image of <dfn>Apú</dfn>, that is “the sun,” and that, whatever
question they addressed was answered by him.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_93" id="fnanchor_93"></a><a href="#footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></span>
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pageno">112</span>
The raiser of this figure was Iskalápíús. In the
opinion of the Magians of Rúmi, it rendered oracles,
because, having been made in strict dependency on
the observation of the motions of the seven planets
at the most suitable moments, it was constituted in
such a manner that one of the spirits of the stars
descended into it; and therefore answered any question
asked from him. The name of this figure was
<span class="title">Saklapes</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_94" id="fnanchor_94"></a><a href="#footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="title">Sabeans</span> believe that in some of their idols a
white hand appears. Further, the wise men of
Persia, Greece, India, and the Sabeans, all acknowledge
the stars as the Kiblah, and the blessed Emperor
(Akbar) also received divine commands with
regard to them.</p>

<p>In the histories of the Turks is to be found that
<span class="person">Jangiskhan</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_95" id="fnanchor_95"></a><a href="#footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></span> worshipped the stars, and several
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pageno">113</span>
things of wonderful meaning were connected with
his person. In the first line was that which they
call the state of <dfn>washt</dfn>. Some of the spirits of the
stars were his assistants. During several days he
was in a swoon, and in this state of senselessness
all that the world-conquering Khan could articulate
was <cite>Hu</cite>, <cite>hu</cite>! It is said that on the first manifestation
of this malady, he obtained union with spirits,
victories, and revelations of mysteries. The very
same coat and garment which he first put on were
deposited in a wardrobe, there sealed up, and kept
by themselves. Every time that the illustrious Khan
fell into this state, his people dressed him in that
coat, and every event, victory, purpose, discovery
of enemies, defeat, conquest of countries, which he
desired, came upon his tongue; a person wrote
down every thing, and put it into a bag which he
sealed. When the world-seizing Khan recovered
his senses, every thing was read to him and he
acted accordingly, and every thing he had said took
place. He possessed perfectly the science of divination
by means of combs, and having burnt them,
gave his decisions in a manner different from that of
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pageno">114</span>
other diviners who paid attention to combs. It is
said that, when this conqueror of the world fell into
the hands of his enemies, he recovered his liberty
by the assistance of Amír Shír Khán, who, having
given him a mare of Kirang, enabled him to join his
men, who had already despaired of his life. Tulí
Khán, who was then in his infancy, said one day:
“My father, sitting upon a mare of Kirang, is coming
near.” On this very day, the Khan returned
in that manner to his camp. When the Turks saw
the wonders of his acts, they opened freely the
road of their affection to him. Such was his justice
and equity, that in his army nobody was bold enough
to take up a whip thrown on the road, except the
proprietor of it; lying and thieving were unknown
in his camp. Every woman among the Khorásánián,
who had a husband living, had no attempt
upon her person to fear. Thus we read in the
<cite>Tabkat Náśeri</cite>, “the degrees of Naśer,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_96" id="fnanchor_96"></a><a href="#footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></span>
that when
<span class="person">Malik Táj-ed din</span>, surnamed the King of Ghór, returned
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pageno">115</span>
with the permission of Jangis Khan, from the
country of Tálkán to Ghór, he related the following
anecdote: When I had left the presence of Jangis
Khan, and sat down in the royal tent, <span class="person">Aghlán
herbí</span>, with whom I came, and some other friends,
were with me, a Moghul brought two other Moghuls,
who the day before had fallen asleep when on
the watch, saying: “I struck their horses with the
whip, rebuking them for their guilt in sleeping, yet
left them; but to-day I have brought them here.”
Aghlan faced these two Moghuls, asking them:
“Have you fallen asleep?” Both avowed it. He
then ordered one of them to be put to death; and that
his head should be tied to the hair lock of the other
the latter then to be conducted through the camp,
and afterwards executed. Thus it was done. I
remained astonished, and said to Aglan: “There
was no witness to prove the guilt of the Moghuls;
as these two men knew that death awaits them,
why have they confessed? If they had denied,
they would have saved themselves.” Aghlan Herbí
replied: “Why art thou astonished? You, Tají
Khan, you act in this way, and tell lies; but,
should a thousand lives be at stake, Moghuls
would not utter a lie.”</p>

<p>Jangis Khan raised <span class="person">Oktáyí Khan</span> to the rank of a
<span class="title">Khalif</span>, “successor.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_97" id="fnanchor_97"></a><a href="#footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></span>
<span class="person">Châtayi Khan</span>, who was his
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pageno">116</span>
elder brother, in a drunken fit dashed his horse
against Oktáyi Khan, and then hurried away. When
he became sober, he reflected upon the danger which
would ensue from his act, and that the foundation
of the monarchy might be destroyed in consequence
of it; therefore, presenting himself as a criminal, he
said to his brother: “How could a man like me
presume to measure himself with the King, and
dash his horse against him! Therefore I am
guilty, and confess my crime. Put me to death,
or use the whip against me: you are the judge.”
Oktáyi replied: “A miserable like myself, what
place should he take? You are the master: what
am I?&mdash;that is, you are the elder, I the younger,
brother.” Finally, Chengháyi, presenting him
nine horses, said: “I offer this as a grateful
acknowledgment that the King did not exercise
his justice towards me, and that he forgives my
crime.”</p>

<p>When <span class="person">Oktáyí Khan</span> dispatched <span class="person">Jermághún</span>, a commander
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pageno">117</span>
of a district furnishing ten thousand men,
with an army of thirty thousand warriors, to reduce
the sultan <span class="person">Jelal eddin</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_98" id="fnanchor_98"></a><a href="#footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></span>
king of Khárazim, at
the time of the breaking up of the army, he said
to one of the Omrás, who was subordinate to Jermaghún:
“The great affair of Jelal eddin in thy
hand will sufficiently occupy thee.” Finally, this
Amir, having fallen upon the Sultan Jelal-eddin in
Kurdistan, destroyed him completely. The liberality
and generosity of Oktáyikán was as conspicuous
as the sun. When <span class="person">Tayir Baháder</span>, in the year
of the Hejira 625 (A. D. 1227) moved the army of
the Moghuls from <span class="place">Abt´al</span> to the country of <span class="place">Sístán</span>, they
besieged the fort <span class="title">Arak</span>; at that time the plague manifested
itself among the Moghuls, so that, at first, a
pain was felt in the mouth, then the teeth moved,
and on the third day death ensued. <span class="person">Malik Sálakín</span>,
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pageno">118</span>
the governor of the fort, fixed upon the stratagem
that seven hundred young men should lie in ambush:
who, when they should hear the sound of the
war-drum from the eastern gate, opposite which they
were placed, were to break out from the ambush, and
fall on the back of the enemies. Conformably with
this plan, in the morning the eastern gate was opened,
and the Muselmans were engaged in the assault;
but when the drum was beaten, nobody came forth
from the ambush: after three watches, a man was
sent to bring intelligence from that quarter, but
he found them all dead.</p>

<p>The world-conquering Jangiz Khan, at the time
of his wasting away, said to his sons: “Never deviate
from your faith, nor lend your powerful
support to other religions; because, as long as
you remain firmly rooted in your faith, your people
and companions will acknowledge you as the
chiefs of their faith, and count you as the leaders
of worship; but he who changes his religion for
that of others, being a chief of the faith, may be
still considered as a chief by the people of the new
religion; but in the eyes of his own people will
lose that dignity: because he who passes over with
you to another faith will esteem as chiefs those of
the new faith; besides, he who remains attached
to my faith will also be displeased with you for
not having continued in the religion of his fathers.”
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pageno">119</span>
To sum up all, as long as they conformed
themselves to the last will of the Khan, they were
powerful; but when they deviated from his counsel,
they sunk into distress and abjection. The stars
were favorable to them in every thing.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_99" id="fnanchor_99"></a><a href="#footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>It is related: Kík Khan, who was of the family of
Chaghaty Khan, was one day walking with noblemen
of his suit in the plain, travelling about in the
desert. At once, his looks fell upon bones; at the
same moment he became thoughtful, and then asked:
“Do you know what this handful of bones says to
me?” They replied: “The King knows best.”
He resumed: “They demand justice from me as
being oppressed.” He demanded information
about the history of these bones from Amír Hazárah,
who held this country under his dependence.
This governor inquired of Amir Sadah, who administered
this district under him; and after reiterated
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pageno">120</span>
investigations, it became clear that, nine years before,
a caravan had been attacked at this place by a
band of highwaymen, and plundered of their property,
a part of which remained still in the hands of
the guilty. At last it was recovered from the murderers,
and restored to the heirs of the slain who
were in Khorásán.</p>

<p>It is said that, when an army of the Moghuls was
occupied with the siege of the fort of <span class="place">Imbál</span>, in which
were the mother and several women of the king of
Khárarem, nobody had ever given information that
the garrison was distressed for want of water. Although
a quantity of rain-water was collected in the
reservoirs, so that during years they had no need of
spring-water, yet at the time when the Moghuls
were encamped before the place to reduce it, no rain
had fallen, and one day not a drop of water remained
in the reservoirs; the next day the women of the
Turks and Naśer eddin, with thirsty lips, compelled
by necessity came down to surrender; but at the
very moment that they arrived at the foot of the fort,
and the army of the Moghuls entered it, a heavy
rain began to pour down, so that the water ran out
from the ditches of the fort. When this intelligence
was brought to the Sultan Muhammed, sovereign of
Khárazem, he become insensible, and when he recovered
his senses, he died without being able to
utter a word.</p>

<p><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pageno">121</span>
Upon the whole: as long as the Sultans of the
Moghuls preserved the worship of the stars, they
conquered the inhabitants of the world; but, as
soon as they abandoned it, they lost many countries,
and those which they kept were without value
and strength.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_100" id="fnanchor_100"></a><a href="#footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></span></p>

According to Sheristání, there is a sect called <span class="title">Hernânites</span>, or <span class="title">Herranites</span>,
disciples of a certain <span class="person">Hernán</span>, a branch of the Sabeans, of whom

four prophets, among whom are Agatho démon and Hermes.</p>

<p class="footnote"><dfn>Agatho démon</dfn>, that is to say, “the good genius,” was an Egyptian
god. According to general belief, this denomination is the approximative
translation of <dfn>Knef</dfn>, or “the good principle,” and in that acceptation
it was applied to other deities, as for instance, to the Nile, and typified
as the emblem of wisdom, prudence, life, health, youth, eternity,
and infinitude, in the <em>inoffensive serpent</em>; now and then this form is
combined with that of other animals. According to some authors, Agatho
demon was the Egyptian <span class="title">Chetnuph</span>; and to him are attributed a number
of works, a list of which is given by Fabricius in his “Bibliotheca

 The first Hermes of the Orientals lived one thousand years after
Adam, in the beginning of their second solar millenium, and was no other
but Idris, or Enoch; the second in the third solar millenium, was the
<span class="title">Trismegist</span> of the Greeks. According to Abu ’l farage, the second was
the third; and between these two intervened a Chaldean or Babylonian
Hermes, who lived a few centuries after the deluge, and to whom the
principal notions of astronomy are referred. A disciple of the first Hermes,
or of Idris, was Esculapius, of whom hereafter.</p>

town with a temple and an oracular statue of Esculapius. One circumstance
is singularly true in the above account of <span class="place">Apu</span>, to wit: that Esculapius

is, “the heat of the sun.”</p>

 Jangís khan, originally called Tamujin, was, according to Chinese and
Moghul authorities (see <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte der Ost-mongolen von Isaak Jacob
Schmidt, Seite</cite> 376), born in the year of the Hejira 558 (A. D. 1162), in
<span class="place">Dilun Jalún</span>. It was in the year 1206 of our era that he received, in a

“Great Khan:” his own tribe, which was that of <span class="title">Moghuls</span>, before him

whose arms he had successfully directed against Baghdad and the Khalif.
The Khan, after his conquests, took up his residence at <span class="place">Maragha</span>, in
<span class="place">Aderbigan</span>; there he assembled philosophers and astronomers to cultivate
science, under the direction of Nâśer eddin. In our days the place

 Jangis Khan had four sons, whose rank of seniority is differently
stated by different authors, and among whom he divided his vast empire.
<span class="person">Octáyi</span> was to rule all the countries of the Moghuls, Kathayans, and
others extending towards the East. He died in the year of the Hejira
639 (A.D. 1241). <span class="person">Châtayí</span> was to possess Mawer ul nahir, Turkistan,
Balkh, and Badakhshan. He died in the year of the Hejira 638 (A.D.
1240). <span class="person">Jují</span> was to reign over Desht, Kapchak, Kharizm, Khizer, Bulgaria,
Lokmin, Alan, As, Russia, and the northern countries. He died in
Hejira 624 (A.D. 1226), during his father’s life. <span class="person">Tuli Khan</span> received
for his share Khorassan, India, and Persia; he died soon after his father;
but his sons, Manjuka, Koblai, and Hulagú became celebrated in history.</p>

 Jangis Khan, during his terrific career, in the fourteenth year of
slaughter, devastation, and conquest, fell upon the empire of Kharism
and Ghazni. Muhammed of the Seljuks was driven from all his possessions,
and died a fugitive. He had before divided his empire between
his four sons, to one of whom <span class="person">Jelál eddin</span>, he had assigned Kharizm,
Khorassan, Mazinderan, Ghazni, Bamian, Ghor, Bost Takanad, Zamigdand,
and all the Indian provinces. This prince, retiring before superior forces
towards Ghazni, gained two battles over the Moghuls, but was at last
obliged to fly to the banks of the Indus. There, closely pressed by the
enemies, who murdered his captive son seven years old before his eyes, he
threw his mother, wife, and the rest of his family, at their own desire,
into the water, and then swam, with a few followers, across the river,
before his admiring pursuers, who followed him no further.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_99" id="footnote_99"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_99"><span class="muchsmaller">[99]</span></a>
 Jangis Khan died in the year of the Hejira 626 (A. D. 1228), in his
sixty-sixth year. He left an empire which extended from the Indus to
the Black sea; from the banks of the Wolga to the remote plains of
China; and from the arid shores of the Persian gulf to the cold deserts of
Siberia. Having, in his early age, been driven by his subjects from his
home, he passed several years under the protection of a Christian prince,
<span class="person">Awenk Khan</span>, or <span class="person">Ungh Khan</span>, known to Europeans under the name of
<span class="person">Prester John</span>; and was therefore supposed by some to have adopted the
Christian religion: thus much is true&mdash;he and his successors protected
the Christians and persecuted the Muhammedans, until <span class="person">Nikudár Oglan</span>
professed the Muhammedan faith, in A. D. 1281, and drove the Christians
out of his empire.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_100" id="footnote_100"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_100"><span class="muchsmaller">[100]</span></a>
 The duration of Jangis Khan’s dynasty reckoned from the year of
the Hejira 599 (A. D. 1202) extended by fourteen princes to 736 (A. D.
1335), comprising 137 lunar, 133 solar, years. It does not appear that
change of religion, by itself, had any influence upon the decline and fall
of this dynasty.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="p2 hanging"><span class="sc">Section IV.&mdash;Upon the sayings of his Majesty
(Akbar), dwelling in the seventh heaven.</span></p>

<p>First, the ordinances of conduct which the Nawab,
the wise and learned Shaikh Abu ’l Fazil wrote,
with the pen of accuracy, by orders of his Majesty,
dwelling in heaven, in order that the governors of
the countries occupied by his sovereignty, and the
clerks, may pay attention to their execution.</p>

<p>This is “God is great;” this is the patent of the
Ilahí faith: and the ordinances of conduct are a work
of instruction, which sprung from the fountain of
benevolence, and the mine of kindness of sovereignty,
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">122</span>
and according to which the regulators of the royal
offices, the managers of the Khalifa’s court among
his fortunate sons, the gentle-minded princes, the
Omrahs, high in dignity, all men of rank, the collectors
of revenues and the Kótwals may settle their
practices; and in the arrangement of important
affairs in great cities and in villages, and in all places
maintain their authority.</p>

<p>The principal point is summarily this: that, in
all transactions, they may endeavor to deserve the
divine favor, by their usages and pious practices;
and that, humbly suppliant in the court of God,
without partial complacence to themselves and to
others, they may execute the law in their proceedings.
Another point is, that they may not too much
like their private apartment; for this is the manner
of the desert-choosing durvishes; that they may not
accustom themselves to sit in the society of common
people, nor to mix in large crowds; for this is
the mode of market people; in short, that they may
keep the medium between the two extremes, and
never forsake the just temperance; that is, avoid
equally excess in dissipation and retirement. Besides,
they are enjoined to venerate those who are
distinguished by devotion to the incomparable God;
to take the habit of vigilance in the morning and
evening, and particularly at midnight; and at all
times, when they are free from the affairs of God’s
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pageno">123</span>
creatures, to occupy themselves with perusing the
books of the masters of purity and sanctity, and
the books of moral philosophy, which is the medicine
of spirituality and the essence of all sciences;
such as <cite>Ikhlák Naseri</cite>, “the Ethics of Naśery;”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_101" id="fnanchor_101"></a><a href="#footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></span>
and <cite>manjíat wa mahelkat</cite>, “the Causes of Salvation
and Perdition,” <cite>Ahyáyí âlúm ál dín</cite>, “the Revival
of the Sciences of Faith;”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_102" id="fnanchor_102"></a><a href="#footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></span>
the <cite>Kimíáyi Sâadet</cite>, Alchymy
of Felicity;”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_103" id="fnanchor_103"></a><a href="#footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></span>
and <cite>Masnaví</cite>, “the poetical
compostion of the Máulavi of Rúm,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_104" id="fnanchor_104"></a><a href="#footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></span>
so that
having attained the highest degree of religious
knowledge, they may not be liable to be moved
from their station by the fictions of the masters of
deceit and falsehood; as in this state of dependence
the best sort of worship is, after all, the most important
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pageno">124</span>
concern of creatures; that, without being
influenced by friendship or enmity, without regard
to relations or strangers, they may with an
open forehead raise themselves to a dignified rank;
further, that they may, to the extent of their power,
confer benefits upon the religious mendicants, the
miserable and indigent, particularly upon the pious
recluse in a corner, and upon the saints, who,
straitened in their expense and income, never
open their lips for a demand; that, being in company
with the pious hermits seeking God, they may
beg their benediction; besides that, having weighed
the faults, errors, and crimes of men in the balance
of justice, they may assign to each his proper place,
and by the balance of well-founded appreciation
bestow retribution upon each; that by the judgment
of sagacious men they may find out in the crowd him
whose faults ought to be concealed and passed
over, and him whose guilt is to be examined, proclaimed,
and punished; for there are faults which
deserve greatly to be repressed, and others which
are to be treated with great indulgence; it is required
that, to show the right way to the disobedient, they
use advice and gentleness, harshness or mildness,
according to the difference of rank and season;
when advice remains without effect, then imprisoning,
beating, maiming of members, and capital
punishment may be inflicted, according to the diversity
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pageno">125</span>
of cases; but in putting a man to death they
ought not to be too rash, but rather employ an
abundance of considerations:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“A head once severed cannot be refitted to the body.”</p>

<p>Whenever practicable, they ought to send the
delinquent worthy of death to the King’s court, and
there represent his case. If keeping him be likely
to occasion an insurrection, or (sending him to the
King’s court) become the cause of trouble, in this
necessity he may be executed; but flaying alive, or
throwing a man under the feet of an elephant, which
is practised by violent kings, ought to be avoided.
The treatment of every man is to be conformable to
his rank and condition; because to a high-minded
man a severe look is equivalent to death, whilst
to an abject person, even flagellation is nothing.
Besides, remission is to be made to any body who,
by his genius, knowledge, and virtue should have
acquired consideration, and when the magistrates
observe in his conduct any thing unbecoming in
their opinion, they ought to tell it to him in private.
If one of the historians of the times relates
something wrong, they are not to rebuke him
severely for it; for a rebuke is a barrier upon the
road of truth-speaking; and he upon whom the
incomparable God has conferred the aptness of
speaking truth, deserves to be accounted precious:
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pageno">126</span>
for men are excessively weak, and those who are of a
mean origin and depraved, have no inclination to
speak truth, but choose to submit to every sort of
abjectness. He who is of a good disposition is cautious
that nothing in his speech may be disagreeable
to the ears of his master, and that he may not
incur disgrace. But the man of noble sentiments,
who prefers his own loss to the advantage of others,
possesses the science of the philosopher’s stone.
Administrators ought not to be fond of flattery,
as many affairs are left undone on account of flatterers;
nor ought they, on the other hand, to ill treat
those who are not flatterers, as a servant may also
be obliged to say unpleasing things.</p>

<p>The judges should attend personally, as much as
possible, to the examination of the plaintiff (<cite>verse of
Sâdi</cite>):</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Throw not his complaint to the diván (tribunal),</div>
  <div class="i0">As he may possibly have to complain of the divan itself.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The plaintiffs ought to be examined in the order
in which their names are inscribed on the list, in
order that he who came first may not be subject to
the inconvenience of waiting. The disposal of precedence
or delay is not to rest with the first registrars
of the court. If a person be accused of acting
criminally, the judges ought not to precipitate his
punishment; for there are many eloquent slanderers,
and few well-intentioned speakers of what is
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pageno">127</span>
right. During the period of anger, they ought not
to let the bridle of reason slip out of their hands,
but act with calmness and reflexion. It becomes
them to grant privileges to some of their friends and
servants, who are distinguished by great wisdom
and devotedness. At the time of overbearing grief
and affliction, when the wise abstain from speaking,
let them not exceed either in words, silence, or
imbecility. They should be sparing with their
oaths, as much swearing raises a suspicion of lying.
They ought not, to accustom themselves to offend an
interlocutor by evil surmises or by bad names: for
these are vile manners. Finally, it is their duty to
show solicitude for the promotion of agriculture,
the welfare of the cultivator, and the assistance of
tenants; in order that, from year to year, the great
cities, the villages, and towns may rise in prosperity,
and acquire such facility of improvement that the
whole land may be rendered fit for cultivation, and
consequently the increase of population be carried
to the utmost.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>These ordinances, separately written, are to be
communicated to every agent of government, that
they may apply their minds to the execution of
them; in short, having given notice of them to all
subjects small and great, the magistrates ought not
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pageno">128</span>
to deviate from them under no circumstance nor in
any manner: and to prevent the soldiers from entering
the houses of the inhabitants without their permission;
besides, in their proceedings, they should
not rely upon their own judgment, but ask the advice
of those who are wiser than themselves; not obtaining
this, they ought nevertheless not to desist
from seeking advice; as it happens frequently that
even the ignorant may indicate the road of truth,
as it was said (<cite>by Sadi</cite>):</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Now and then, from the aged sage,</div>
  <div class="i0">Right advice is not derived;</div>
  <div class="i0">Now and then, the unmeaning ignorant</div>
  <div class="i0">By accident hits the butt with his arrow.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Moreover, advice is not to be asked from many
persons: for, right judgment in practical life is a
particular gift of God; it is not acquired by reading,
nor is it found by good fortune. It may also happen,
that a set of ignorant men opposes thy endeavors,
and causes irksome embarrassment in thy
way, so as to retain thee from the dictates of thine
own reason, and from the right-acting men, whose
number is always small.</p>

<p>The magistrates are also directed never to charge
their sons with a business which belongs to servants;
and never to be a guarantee for what is done by
their sons; as thou canst easily find amends for
what passes between others; but, for what occurs
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">129</span>
to thee a remedy is difficult. It may become thee
to listen to excuses, and to look with half-shut eyes
at some faults; for there is no man without guilt or
defect; rebuke sometimes renders him but bolder;
sometimes depresses him beyond measure. There
are men who must be reprehended at each fault;
there are others in whom a thousand faults must be
overlooked; in short, the affair of punishment does
not suit the dignity of the important concerns of
royalty, and is to be carried with calmness and
judgment to its proper aim. A governor ought to
grant all facilities to God-fearing and zealous men,
and to inquire from them the good and the bad,
never ceasing to collect information: for royalty
and command borrow security from vigilance. He
ought not to oppose the creed and religion of the
creatures of God: inasmuch as a wise man chooses
not his loss in the affairs of this perishable world,
how in those of religion, which is permanent and eternal,
should he knowingly tend to his perdition? If
God be with his faith, then thou thyself carriest on
controversy and opposition against God; and if God
fails him, and he unknowingly takes the wrong
way, then he proves to himself a rule of erroneous
profession, which demands pity and assistance,
not enmity or contradiction. Those who act and
think well, bear friendship to every sect. Besides,
they avoid excess in sleeping and eating, without
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pageno">130</span>
deviating from the measure of what is necessary, so
that, rising above the relinquished step of brutishness,
they attain a distinguished rank of humanity.
Let it be recommended to watch by night as much
as possible; never to show violent enmity towards
any man; and to beware of making one’s bosom the
prison-house of rancour; should it nevertheless take
place from the infirmity of human nature, let it soon
be stifled: for, in the interior of our soul resides the
true agent, the unparallelled God, and raises tumultuous
strife for the sake of provoking the investigation
of truth.</p>

<p>A governor should disdain laughing and joking:
he should always be informed of every occurrence
by spies; but never rely upon the information of one
of them, because truth and disinterestedness are
rare among them; therefore, in every affair, let
him appoint several spies and intelligencers, who
are not to know each other; and, having written
down separately the account given by each of them;
compare them with each other. But the notorious
spies are to be dismissed and discarded from his
presence, nor access granted to persons of mean
birth and depraved habits, although this sort of
people may be usefully employed against other bad
men; but he should never let the account-book slip
out of his hands, and always entertain in his heart
suspicion against this class of men, that they may
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pageno">131</span>
not perhaps, under the guise of friendship, usurp
the place of honest men. Let him observe those
near him and his servants, that they may not, on
account of their approaching him, oppress others.
He ought to be on his guard against the flattering-tongued
liars, who in the garb of friendship act the
part of real enemies, as disorders are occasioned by
their agency. Great personages, on account of
abundant occupations, have little, but these malefactors
have a great deal of leisure; therefore, from
all sides and quarters, precautions against the latter
are required. To cut short all prolixity, a governor
ought to find men worthy of confidence, and
pay the greatest attention to the promotion of knowledge
and industry, so that men of talent may not
fall off from their high station among men. He
ought besides to favor the good education of the old
families of the royal court.</p>

<p>The warlike requisites and arms of the soldiers
are by no means to be neglected. Further, the
expenses must always be less than the revenues:
this last is of the most essential concern, for it is
said: Whoever spends more than he receives is
a blockhead; he who equals his expense and income
is to be accounted neither wise nor stupid;
but he lays no foundation of any establishment;
he is always subject to service, expecting favor,
and dependant upon promises. A commander is
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pageno">132</span>
bound to be true in his words, particularly with
the functionaries of government. Let him constantly
practise shooting with arrows and guns, and
exercise the soldiers in arms; but not be passionately
devoted to hunting, although he may sometimes
indulge in it for the training of troops, and
the recreation of the mind, which is indispensable in
this world of dependencies. He is never permitted
to take corn from the class of the Rayas, with the
intention to hoard it up for selling it at a high price.
Let him attend to the beating of the kettle-drum at
the rising of that luminary which bestows light upon
the world; and at midnight, which is properly the
beginning of sunrise, and during the progress of the
great majestic light from station to station, let him
order small and great guns to be fired, so that all
men be called up to offer thanks to God.</p>

<p>Somebody ought to be placed at the gate of the
court, for bringing all petitions before the high presence
of the King. If there be no <dfn>Kútwál</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_105" id="fnanchor_105"></a><a href="#footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></span>
he ought,
observing well the parts and rules of it, to apply
himself to the performance of this office, and not on
account of considering it rustic (low) business, say
to himself: “How can I do the business of a Kútwál?”
but from piety acknowledging the greatness
of God, he ought to submit to this charge.</p>

<p><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">133</span>
To explain clearly its duties, the first of all is,
that the Kútwál of every city, town, and village
write down, with the agreement of the people,
their houses and buildings; as well as register in a
book the inhabitants of every part of a place from
house to house, and, having taken security from
house to house, grant them free intercourse with
each other; having determined the divisions in each
of them, a head man of the division is to be appointed,
so that the good and bad men may be
under his superintendence; he must also appoint
spies, by whose means every occurrence by night
and day, the arrivals and departures in each quarter,
are to be recorded. He ought to establish that,
whenever a theft is committed, fire breaks out, or
any other mishap takes place, at the very moment
succor be given by the neighbors, and likewise all
householders tender their services: if they be absent
without necessity, they are to be held guilty. Nobody
can undertake a journey without giving information
of it to his neighbor, the head man of the
division, or the recorder of news. No man of bad
character is to be received in any quarter of the place,
and all those who have not given security, are to be
kept separate from the other inhabitants in the great
public house, to which a head man and a recorder
of news are to be attached. The Kútwal ought to
be perpetually informed of the income and expense of
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
every individual, for the sake of survey and precaution,
and fix his attention on it: for, any body whose
income is small and expense great, cannot certainly
be without guilt. It is incumbent on him to follow
an indication, and never to be remiss in attention to
persons of good birth and right intentions. This
inquiry is to be understood as a measure of order,
and not as the means of rapine and oppression.
Further, the Kútwal’s business is to establish in the
bazar, “market,” brokers of all sorts, after having
taken security from them, that he may receive notice
of whatever is bought and sold. He ought to
declare that whoever buys or sells anything without
notice, is subject to a fine. The names of the buyer
and seller are to be entered into a daily register, and
nothing is to be bought or sold without the consent
of the head man of the division. Moreover, the
Kútwál must appoint guards for watching at night
in every quarter, every street, and in the whole
district of the town, and endeavor that in the quarters,
bazars, and streets no stranger be found; he
must apply to the search and pursuit of thieves and
pickpockets, and other delinquents, and leave no
trace of them. Whatever is purloined or plundered
he must bring forth, together with the pilferers,
and if not, by returning the equivalent, he must
make good the damages. It is his duty to ascertain
the property of strangers and deceased persons, in
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pageno">135</span>
order that, if there be heirs, he may remit it to
them, and if not, deliver it to the Amín, “superintendant,”
and write an explanation thereof to the
Royal court, so that at any time when the true proprietor
is discovered, he may be put in possession
of it. In this transaction too, he ought to manifest
his right principles and his good origin, so as, perhaps,
to come up to what is customary in the country
of Rúm. The Kútwal is further bound to endeavor
that there be no trace of wine-drinking to be
found, and to reprehend, with the concurrence of
the judge, the buyer and seller, the abettor and
perpetrator thereof; so that the people may take an
example from it; nevertheless, if any body, of high
character for prudence for the sake of relaxation of
mind, makes use of wine as a medicine, no opposition
is to be made to his usage.</p>

<p>The Kútwal must be sollicitous for the cheapness
of provisions, and not allow rich men to buy and to
hoard a large quantity to sell it dear afterwards.
Let him take care of providing the requisites for the
<dfn>Náúroz</dfn>, “new year,” this is a great festival, the
beginning of which is the time when the great world-illuming
luminary enters the sign of Aries, at the
commencement of the month <span class="time">Farvardin</span> (March).
Another feast is on the 19th of the said month,
which is the day of the most glorious sun. Other
feasts are as follows: the 3rd of <span class="time">Ardíbihest</span> (April);
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">136</span>
the 6th of <span class="time">Khórdád</span> (May); the 10th of <span class="time">Abán</span> (October);
the 9th of <span class="time">Azar</span> (November), in the month
of <span class="time">Dáí</span> (December) are three festivals, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> on the
8th, the 15th, and the 23rd; besides, the 2nd of
<span class="time">Bahman</span> (January), and the 15th of <span class="time">Isfendármend</span>
(February). The known festivals are to be celebrated
according to regulations; and the nights of
the <span class="time">Náú-róz</span> and <span class="time">Sherif</span>, “glorious,” are to be illuminated
by torches, in the manner of the night <span class="time">Bharát</span>,
in the 8th Arabian month, called <dfn>Shâabán</dfn>,
“consecrated to the memory of forefathers;” and
in the first night which is followed by the morning
of a festival, the kettle-drum is to be beaten, which
is also to be done on an elephant’s back on all festivals.
A woman ought never, without necessity,
to appear on horseback. The Kútwál is enjoined
to separate the fords of rivers for bathing from
those for fetching water, and to assign particular
fords to women.</p>

<p>The emperor inhabiting the seventh heaven, Akbar,
wrote a book of advice for the King Ahás Safaví,
and this was also penned by Shaikh Abu ’l Fazil.
Some precepts from this book are as follows: The
high personages of the people, who are the depositors
of the divine secrets, are to be considered with
eyes of benign admiration, and kept with zeal in our
conciliated hearts. Acknowledging that the bounty
of the incomprehensible God embraces all religions,
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pageno">137</span>
let us entirely devote ourselves to the culture of
flowers in the rose garden of the perpetual spring
of peace, and unceasingly attend to the <dfn>Nas eb ul âyín</dfn>,
“establishment of the thing itself,” as to the study
of promoting one’s happiness; as the Almighty God,
opening the door of his bounty to the different religions<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_106" id="fnanchor_106"></a><a href="#footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></span>

in their various means of salvation, maintains
them; so, in imitation of him, it is incumbent on the
powerful Kings, who are the shades of divine providence,
never to desist from this rule, because the
Creator of the universe confided to them this vast
population for the sake of directing the state of the
apparent world, and of watching over all mankind,
not without preserving the good name of exalted
families.</p>

<p>In Multan, we saw the Shah Salám ulla; he was
a man unmarried, attached to the unity of God, and
to sanctity; having retired from the world, he said:
“I was often in the society of Jelál eddin Akbar; I
heard him frequently say: ‘Had I possessed before
the knowledge which I now have, I would
never, for my sake, have taken a wife; for to me
the elder matrons are mothers, women of my
age sisters, and the younger ones daughters.’”
One of my friends heard this speech, which has just
been attributed to the blessed emperor, from the
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pageno">138</span>
mouth of the Nawáb Abu ’l Hassen, surnamed Lashker
Khán Mashhedí. Shah Salam ulla related also
that he heard the lord khalífah of God say, weeping:
“Would to God my body were the greatest of all,
that the inhabitants of the world might take their
food from it, and not hurt any other living being.”
A proof of the extensive views of this celebrated
King was, that he employed in his service men of
all nations&mdash;Firangis, Jews, Iráníans, and Turáníans;
because, if they were all of one nation, they
would be disposed to rebellion, as it was the case
with the Usbéks, and the Kazel báshan, who dethroned
their sultan; but the King Abás, son of
sultan Khodabendah Safaví, who succeeded him,

 <span class="title">Rumí</span> is the surname under which <span class="person">Ali Ebn Abbas</span>, an illustrious poet,
is most known. He was of Turkish origin, but born in Syria. He composed
several works, which Avisenna used to read with delight, and the
most difficult passages of which he commented. He died in the year
of the Hejira 283 (A. D. 896)&mdash;(see Herbelot). But the poet above alluded
to is <span class="person">Mawlana Jelal eddin Rumí</span>, whose proper name is Muhammed
of Balkh, who derives his origin from Muhammed, son of Amam.
He is praised as the greatest mystical poet of the Orient, the oracle of the
Súfís, the nightingale of contemplative life, the author of the Masnavi
(a double-rhymed poem), the founder of the Mawlavis, the most celebrated
order of mystic Durvishes. He died in the year of the Hejirah
661 (A. D. 1262). We shall quote hereafter a specimen of his poetry.&mdash;(See

<p class="center">OF THE RELIGION OF THE WISE (PHILOSOPHERS),</p>

<p class="center smaller">IN THREE SECTIONS.</p>

<p class="hanging smaller"><span class="sc">Section <abbr title="Three">III</abbr>.</span> Of the wise men, and of late philosophers, and of those
of that class who existed among all the nations of the children
of Adam, and still exist; named in Persian <span class="title">Zirek</span>, and <span class="title">Farzanah</span>;
in Hindi <span class="title">Budhvan</span>, <span class="title">Badisher</span>, <span class="title">Set mat</span>, <span class="title">Set pati</span>, <span class="title">Kianisher</span>,
<span class="title">Chater</span>, <span class="title">Pah danter</span>, and <span class="title">Jami</span>; in Greek <span class="title">Filsofi</span>; and
in Arabic <span class="title">Hakim</span>.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging"><span class="sc">Section <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>&mdash;Of the religion of the philosophers,
and of some branches of their questions.</span></p>

<p>The distinguished men of that class divide themselves
into two sorts: the one are the Oriental, the
other the Occidental. As to the religious customs
of the Orientals, let it be known, that they are also
called <dfn>Ravákín</dfn>, and in Persian <dfn>Keshísh</dfn>, “the religious,”
<dfn>Pertaví</dfn>, “the splendent,” and <dfn>Róshendil</dfn>,
“the enlightened,” and in Hindí <dfn>Ner mel men</dfn> and
<dfn>Jókísher</dfn>: these names relate to sanctity. The Occidentals
are called in Persian <dfn>Rah berí</dfn>, “way-guides,”
and <dfn>Joya</dfn>, inquirers;” in Hindí <dfn>Tárkek</dfn>.</p>

<p>As to their tendency and opinions&mdash;whatever relates
to the creed of the Orientals has already been
stated in the chapter on the <span class="title">Yezdáníán</span>, who are
also entitled <span class="title">Azarhóshangían</span>, but all that is attributed
to the two sects is symbolical. The ancient
philosophers of Greece, down to <span class="person">Aflátún</span> (Plato), were
Oriental; it was Araśtu (Aristotle), his disciple, who
then took the lead in the doctrine, the centre of
which with this class is the argumentative reason.
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pageno">140</span>
Both sects, by means of their discussions, cannot
explain the nature of the self-existing being; the
essence, unity, particularity, and all attributes are
inherent in his holy nature, as I have said in the
account of the religion of the Hoshanganíans. They
have said besides: God is the world in its universality,
but in its particularity mutable conformably
with the whole, as it has been stated in the doctrine
of the Yezdánían. They maintain, the work of God
is according to his will; he does; if he wills not, he
does not; but a good work is conformable to his
nature: because all his attributes are perfection, in
which sense they draw necessary conclusions with
regard to the nature of God.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The year of God is that which passeth away; and thou shalt not find
a change in the years of God.”</p>

<p>Their creed is: God is not the immediate actor;
as it would not be suitable to the dignity of royalty
and sovereignty to perform himself every business;
but it is proper that he should appoint some one of
his servants who, on account of his great knowledge
and power, is qualified for business, for the execution
of the royal orders and the protection of the
subjects. The latter also may, by the Sultan’s order,
name another as Vizir or Nawab, for the affairs;
every one of these chiefs may instal functionaries
or agents; so that the whole administration may be
firmly established according to the desire and the
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pageno">141</span>
order of the sovereign. On that account, God created
a first intellect, called in Persian <dfn>Bahman</dfn>, that is,
“supreme soul,” or <dfn>Barósú</dfn>, or <dfn>Ferósu</dfn>, or <dfn>Serósh
seróshán</dfn>, and “the science of truth;” he who produced
something “new;” he is also entitled “the
true man: ‘<cite>God created man according to his image</cite>;’”
that is to say, pure, uncompounded, like reason,
betwixt necessity and possibility,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_107" id="fnanchor_107"></a><a href="#footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></span>
in the centre between
both; necessity is on his right side, possibility
on his left; the perfect spirit rises from the left,
which is the side of possibility. With respect to
truth, the image of man is <dfn>âkl</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_108" id="fnanchor_108"></a><a href="#footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></span>
“spirit of wisdom,
the holy spirit, and the image of Eva a perfect
spirit: on that account it was said that the forthcoming
of Eva took place from Adam’s left side. The
Sofis also agree with this, as we find it explained by
Shaikh Muhammed Láhají,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_109" id="fnanchor_109"></a><a href="#footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></span>
in his work <cite>Sharah-i-Gulshen</cite>,
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pageno">142</span>
“the Commentary of the Rose-bower.”
Jesus, the son of God, proceeds from this “holy
spirit.” When wisdom manifests itself through
somebody, it is called his “spirit of wisdom;” and
when impressions of sciences in all creatures have
penetrated through its mediation, it is named “arrow;”
and as the perfection of the lord of the prophetic
asylum is a ray of that jewel, it bears the
name of “Muhammed’s light.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“If not for thee, I would not have created the worlds.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_110" id="fnanchor_110"></a><a href="#footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>These are the attributes of its nature, and besides
these it has many names. By the intervention of
the first intelligence came forth the second intelligence,
the spirit and body of “the crystalline heaven;”
and the soul of the heaven above the crystalline
firmament is called “<dfn>haváyi mânavi</dfn>, “the
true soul.” By the intervention of the second
intelligence, the third, and the spirit and body of
the heaven of the fixed stars were produced. In
this wonderful way, intelligences and spirits were
formed, until the spirits of the tenth class;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_111" id="fnanchor_111"></a><a href="#footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></span>
among
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pageno">143</span>
these ten bringers of good news (Evangelists) are
distinguished; likewise nine heavens were brought
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pageno">144</span>
into existence, that they may correspond to nine
prophets. From the tenth class of intelligences
came forth the matter of the elements, and bodies,
and the spirits of elemental existence. The philosophers
said, that ten kinds of intelligences are enumerated,
not because there may not exist any more,
but because these are required; and likewise we
want the number of nine heavens, without its being
prohibited to add any other. The Eastern philosophers
however declare themselves against numbering
the kinds of intelligences, because, with
them every kind of thing has its god, whom they
call “the god of the species,” in Persian <span class="trans">Dára</span>, the
angel of rains, the angel of rivers, to which the following
sentence relates:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Each thing has its angel to whom it is confided, and an angel descends
with every drop.”</p>

<p>The Oriental philosophers hold the bodies to be
shadows of the uncompounded lights.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Seest thou not that God has spread his shadow over me?”</p>

<p>According to the sages, the kinds of intelligences
and spirits of heaven are the heavenly angels, who
have no body nor any thing corporeal, neither feathers
nor wings. When an effulgence of the luminous
attributes of the self-existing Being falls upon
them, it is by the mediating power of this ray, that
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pageno">145</span>
deeds of wonderful purity proceed from them; and
in this production there is no need of a motion, nor
of an instrument, in like manner as in the forthcoming
of a work of God his will is sufficient. This
meaning has been made intelligible to the understanding
of the vulgar by saying, that an angel with
feathered wings traversed the distance of a road
which could not be travelled over in a thousand
years. They say also that Isráfíl is one of the powers
of the sun; the angel of death proceeds from Saturn;
Míkáil from the moon; and Jebríil emanated from
the tenth power of intelligence. As often as, on
account of the revolution of the heavens or the motion
of the stars, something suitable manifests itself
in the elemental matter, compounded and uncompounded,
it issues into existence by way of emanation
from the superior wisdom; and the revelation
of the prophet, and the instruction of the perfect to
mankind, takes place by the intervention of the last-mentioned
angel. On that account there is an intrinsic
connexion between the souls of the prophets
and this by-standing angel. According to the Eastern
philosophers, Jabríil is a god of a kind similar
to human nature, and called in Persian <dfn>Wakhshur</dfn>,
“prophet,” and <dfn>Serósh pajám sipár</dfn>, “Serosh, the
message-bringer.” In the opinion of the philosophers,
the crystalline heaven is the ninth heaven,
and the heaven of the fixed stars the throne of God.
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">146</span>
The exalted rational spirit is without an habitation,
and, without being in the body, is connected with it,
in a manner similar to that of a lover with his mistress.
This doctrine is very ancient with the Orientals,
as has been stated in the account about the Azar
Hóshangían, but with the first master among the
learned, Aristotle and his followers, it is a tradition.
According to general consent, the soul is eternal.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Believe not that those who were killed in the way of God are dead;
on the contrary, they are living and nourished at the side of their
Lord.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_112" id="fnanchor_112"></a><a href="#footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>To unite the soul with the body is as much as
to drive Adam from heaven; to long for the body
is to bear the commands of Eva; and to perform
bad actions is to eat of the forbidden tree; anger is
the serpent; lust is the peacock. They hold that
Iblis represents the power of imagination which
guides us, and the sensual influence which denies
the knowledge of words and things consentient
with reason, and contends with the power of reason;
that what is stated in the law, that all angels
prostrated themselves before Adam, except Iblis,
signifies that all bodily powers, which are the angels
of the earth, are obedient to the soul of Adam,
except the power of imagination, that is Iblis, which
is rebellious, and sometimes gets the better of
judgment. Reason says, that a corpse is to be
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pageno">147</span>
accounted a mineral, and no wise to be feared; but
imagination says: “this is true; nevertheless we
“must fear;” and when one finds himself in a house
alone with a dead man, it may happen that his
mind experiences an agitation of terror. The Súfis
too agree with this, as we find it expressed by the
venerable Shaikh Mahmúd Shósterí<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_113" id="fnanchor_113"></a><a href="#footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></span>
in a chapter of
the <dfn>Merát ul Mohakakín</dfn>, “the mirror of the investigators
of truth.” It is stated in the <dfn>Akhván ús afá</dfn>,
“the companions of purity,” of Mullá Alí, that there
were intelligences and spirits which were not ordered
to adore Adam, as being of a higher rank, as
it is written in the Koran, that God, the All-just,
addressed this speech to Iblis:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Thou art proud; believest thou thyself to be one of the more exalted
beings?”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_114" id="fnanchor_114"></a><a href="#footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>And this was the occasion on which the angels of
the earth were ordered to adore Adam.</p>

<p>The Orientals maintain that when the soul realises,
as it ought to do, the conditions of its primitive
origin, it obtains emancipation from the bodily
bonds, and joins the intelligences and spirits: this
exalted dignity is Paradise.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pageno">148</span>
“O peaceful soul, return to thy lord willingly and readily; and whoever
desires to meet his lord, let him perform good works.”</p>

<p>In this high state it is possible to behold the face
of God. There is another sect which asserts, that
the All-Just is visible; they say right; because the
rational soul sees with interior eyes: another sect
which denies the seeing of God is also right; because
he cannot be seen with bodily eyes,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The eyes attain him, and attain him not.”</p>

<p>But the soul which has left the narrow prison of
the body, but has not attained the field of its beatifying
residence, unites, for taking a seat, with the
body of any one of the celestial spheres with which
it has some relation; it finds rest in the higher or
lower heavens, according to order and distinction;
it is engaged in the contemplation of beauteous
forms, and the noble endowments of one who praises
God in the delight of that sphere, which, with some,
means the fancy of a particular kind, and is blessed
by the enjoyment of delightful imaginations and
representations. What is stated in the code of law,
that the souls of the vulgar among the believers are
in the first heaven; this is founded upon the words
of the prophet.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“His acquisition is but a known place.”</p>

<p>The meaning of this relates to the different degrees
of merit.</p>

<p>By “Paradise” is understood one of the heavens,
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">149</span>
eight of which are counted, and these are beneath
the ninth, which is the roof of the Paradise, as it is
stated in the traditions. But, when the souls not
yet come forth from the pit of the natural darkness
of bodily matter, are nevertheless in a state of increasing
improvement, then, in an ascending way,
they migrate from body to body, each purer than
the former one, until the time of climbing up to
the steps of the wished-for perfection of mankind,
yet according to possibility, after which, purified of
the defilement of the body, they join the world of
sanctity: and this final migration (death) is called
<i>nasikh</i>, “obliteration.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The verses which we have abrogated, we have replaced by others.”</p>

<p>Some call this state <dfn>Aâráf</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_115" id="fnanchor_115"></a><a href="#footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></span> “boundary;” which
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">150</span>
means a wall between heaven and hell, behind
which shall be those who in their conduct fell short
of goodness, until the time of being permitted to
enter into heaven. If the iniquities of the souls
predominate, then, descending, they assume the
forms of animals corresponding to their prevailing
character: thus, the souls of the powerful malefactors
and of the furious enter into the bodies of
lions; the proud become tigers; the formidable,
wolves; and the crafty and covetous appear as little
ants; in this manner they are all ravenous, grazing,
flying, creeping; and this state of things is called
<dfn>masakh</dfn>, “metamorphosis.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“As often as their skin is burnt we renew it with another, in order
that they may taste punishment.”</p>

<p class="blockquote p0">“There is no kind of beast on earth, nor fowl which flieth with its
wings, but the same is a people like unto you.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_116" id="fnanchor_116"></a><a href="#footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, descending, the souls are united with
vegetable bodies; and this is entitled <i>rasakh</i>, “firmness.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Under the form which thy master wills.”</p>

<p>Sometimes they enter into mineral bodies, as for
instance into metals; and this is named <i>fasakh</i>,
“fracture.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“We let you grow according to your acts.”</p>

<p>The learned Umer Khíyam says:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pageno">151</span>
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Endeavor to acquire praise worthy qualities: for, in the field of destiny,</div>
  <div class="i2">Thy resurrection shall be in conformity with thy qualities.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>This threefold division they call “hell.” The
number of the stories of hell, according to the followers
of the law, is seven; that of the simple elements,
four; and that of the compound elements,
three: altogether seven. Every soul, on leaving the
elemental world, enters into one of the stories of
hell. According to the <dfn>Masháyíns</dfn>, “Peripatetics,”
the human soul which, during its connection with
the body has contracted bad habits, becomes afflicted
and distressed by the impurity of such human attributes
as are accounted defects of the mind: on account
of the extinction of sensual pleasure which
had grown into a fixed habit, the soul is bewildered,
and its base customs and qualities bear manifestly
upon it under the guise of a serpent, a scorpion, a
burning fire, and by all the torments which are
recorded in the law-book, whilst, on the contrary,
the noble habits of the virtuous shine under the
guise of <dfn>Huris</dfn>, <dfn>Kásurs</dfn>, sons, and youths, and in all
the blessings of heaven.</p>

<p><dfn>Sirá</dfn>[<dfn>´t</dfn>], “the bridge of the last judgment,” signifies
nothing else but the temperature of power; as
it has been established in the doctrine of Ethics:
for instance, the excess of courage is temerity, a
deficiency in it is cowardice; a medium between
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pageno">152</span>
both is valour and, as to keep the middle tenor, is
very difficult, this has been emblematized by something
which is finer than a hair and sharper than
the edge of a sword, and by three arches, which
indicate the due mixture of three powers, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>:
knowledge, courage, and lust. Under hell is meant
elemental nature.</p>

<p>We shall pass to the interpretation of the gates
of heaven, the number of which is eight; that of the
gates of hell, seven. It is established that there are
five external senses and five internal; but all of
them are not apt to perceive without the assistance
of inference and imagination; because it is imagination
which perceives the forms, and inference
completes the perception of sensible things. The
two internal with the five external senses, make
seven. If they attend not to the commands of reason,
each of them goes for imprisonment to that hell
which is under the heaven of the moon, and if they
listen to these commands, they reach with the ninth
rank of intelligence the eight gates of heaven for
salvation and emancipation, as well as enter the
Paradise which is among the heavens.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“As to him who disobeyed, and preferred the worldly life, hell shall
be his abode; and as to him who feared the being of the Lord and
refused to give up his soul to concupiscence, Paradise shall be his
abode.”</p>

<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pageno">153</span>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Upon the angels of punishment.</span>&mdash;It is to be
known, that there are seven rulers of the world
over the seven stars which revolve within the twelve
signs of the zodiac; seven and twelve make nineteen,
and over these nineteen rulers, that is, managers of
the world, are other nineteen inspectors. In the
space of the nether earth are seven powers of vegetation,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: that of nourishment, watering, birth,
retention, attraction, mildness, and repulsion.
There are twelve powers of animal life, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: five
external, five internal senses, and two powers of
movement, namely, lust and anger. Mankind, as
long as they remain in prison beneath the heaven of
the moon, and not severed from sensuality and its
ties, is indispensably and continually subject to the
impressions of the upper and nether rulers, and to
sufferings; but if it rids itself of these conditions, it
enjoys freedom in this and in the other world.</p>

<p><span class="title">Nakir</span> and <span class="title">Monkir</span> point to our praise-worthy or
blameable conduct. The body is a tomb, and so is
the belly of the mother, and the interior part of the
heaven of the moon.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging"><span class="sc">An account of the pages of human Actions and their
recorders; and of the Descent of Angels and
demons to the Good and the Wicked.</span></p>

<p>Know that, of every speech or action which is
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pageno">154</span>
said or done, a mark is made by them; and when,
in any one of them a repetition occurs, the mark
becomes permanent, as it may be assimilated to what
takes place in acquiring a knowledge or learning an
art. As the marks of good and bad actions of mankind
are determined, so every body shares accordingly
pleasure or pain. Words or deeds, one by
one, being revealed and described, establish conviction;
so that disavowal becomes impossible. This
is the office of two recorders, the one of whom
stands to the right and the other to the left; whatever
of one’s speeches and actions is praise-worthy,
this is called “angelic;” and whatever is blameable
is named “satanic.” This is what the prophet of
Arabia said: “<cite>From goodness arises an Angel, from
badness a Satan.</cite>” The balance typifies the rule of
justice in the retribution of conduct, so that there
may not be any disparity; the basins of the balance
contain the good and bad actions; if the basin of the
first descends heavy, everlasting heaven is bestowed;
if it ascend light, hell.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“He whose weight is heavy, shall be admitted to a delightful life;
and he whose weight is light, shall fall into hell.”</p>

<p>Praiseworthy speeches and actions are the properties
of dignity, steadfastness and peace of mind;
blameable words and deeds belong to perturbation,
doubt, and want of conviction; he who acquires
composure and dignity of mind, obtains the grace
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pageno">155</span>
of God; this grace is the treasurer of paradise, who
is <dfn>Razvan</dfn>, “the porter of heaven;” but doubt and
perturbation are the leaders to misfortune and to
disdain; and disdain is the treasurer of hell, who is
called <dfn>Málik</dfn>, “the keeper of hell.”</p>

<p class="p2 hanging"><span class="sc">An account of mountains and seas, and of what
occurs upon the earth of the last judgment.</span></p>

<p>It should be known, that a mountain can be the
emblem of a body, which is as overgrown with wool,
and the seas can signify the elements; or it may be
proper to call the mountains “elements, which are
opaque,” and the seas “the skies.” Besides,
from a mountain, bodies can be desired; as it may
be the station of angels, and from the sea angels
proceed. Attempting to investigate the nature of
God we meet with a veil, and this veil is darkness.
The only light we find is, that whoever travels over
the stages of materiality and spirituality, attains
rest in the seat of purity,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Near the mighty King.”</p>

<p>The veils of darkness are like colored wool raised up.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The mountains shall become like carded wool of various colors
driven by the wind.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_117" id="fnanchor_117"></a><a href="#footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pageno">156</span>
He lifts up the immense veil before the light, as
then the contradiction, the mutual opposition, and
the unsuitableness of conduct which arises from the
sensuality of the body, vanish at the passing away of
the body; conformity and concord, which belong to
unity and harmony, manifest themselves; certainly
nothing of repugnancy and no sort of apprehension
remains; the poison of serpents and of scorpions is
no more; the wolf associates with the sheep, the
falcon with the little partridge, and confidence between
those who feared each other, appears;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“When the animals will unite.”</p>

<p class="unindent">When there is no body, there is no death. This is

death will be summoned and annihilated;”
he likewise said: “On the day of the last
judgment hell will be made visible:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Hell manifests itself to whosoever looks.”</p>

<p>On no other day but this, hell, as it is, can be
seen; because one who is plunged in the ocean, how
can he see the ocean? It is when he rises above
the waves that he can distinguish them:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“A spirit appears better on the border of an expanse.”</p>

<p>I have now given an explanation about the streams
of heaven and hell; the pleasures and pains during
the time of the soul’s progress and regress. The
running streams signify life, which the celestial community
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pageno">157</span>
enjoys; milk is the cause of nourishment in
early infancy, and is more excellent than water;
because, although its use be at times salutary for all,
yet, in different circumstances, it is not so for all.
Rivers of milk signify rivers of knowledge for noble
persons; they proceed from the origin and development
of sciences, and from these rivers is derived
the enjoyment of the celestial beings, whose state
may be compared to that of infancy. Honey is the
cause of recovery to the sick and afflicted, and is
more excellent than milk, because its advantage is
reserved to a certain number only; and rivers of
honey in heaven are emblematical of rivers of noble
sciences; and the enjoyment of the select in heaven
is derived from these rivers. Wine is the cause of
the removal of terror, and fear, and sadness; and is
more excellent than honey, because it is prohibited
to the people of the world, and permitted and legal
to the inhabitants of heaven; and it is a purifying
draught of the water of Paradise:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Their lord made them drink a purifying beverage.”</p>

<p class="unindent">And rivers of wine in heaven signify rivers of knowledge,
for the nobles, among noble personages, and
their enjoyment in heaven is derived from these
rivers:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“There will be rivers of limpid water, and rivers of milk,</div>
  <div class="i0">The savor of which shall not be altered; rivers of wine</div>
  <div class="i0">Will be a delight to those who drink of them;</div>
  <div class="i0">And there will be rivers of purified honey.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pageno">158</span>
For the inhabitants of hell are four rivers, in opposition
to those in heaven; they are called “that of
heat; that of water, blood, and matter; that of
liquid pitch: and that of poison;” that is to say:
death, ignorance, simple ignorance, and compound
ignorance; for it is said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“These are the similes which we propose to men; the wise only understand
their explanation.”</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="p2 hanging"><span class="sc">Account of the tree <span class="title">TUBA</span>, which is in heaven, and
the tree <span class="title">ZAKUM</span>, which is in hell.</span></p>

<p>It is to be known that <span class="title">Túba</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_118" id="fnanchor_118"></a><a href="#footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></span> is a celestial tree
which sends branches into every corner of heaven;
and this is an emblem of the tree of wisdom, from
which branches extend to every corner&mdash;to any
body, whether it be elemental or imaginary; that is
to say, to every mind which is illumed and warmed
by a ray of the sun of wisdom; it is by this light
that his speech and conduct answer the exigency of
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pageno">159</span>
wisdom, and that he considers well the end of his
actions; so that he has never to repent of any one of
his words or deeds, which is a sign of knowledge.</p>

<p>The tree <span class="title">zakúm</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_119" id="fnanchor_119"></a><a href="#footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></span> represents the tree of nature, a
branch of which extends to every corner, that is to
say, whatever power a man (actuated by it) exerts,
he never considers the end of the action which he
does, and has therefore always to repent of his words
and deeds, which is a sign of ignorance.</p>

<p>As to an explanation about the Har and Kasur, it
is to be known that both names relate to secrets of
hidden things and sciences, which are concealed from
the eyes of the profane by a veil, or by the pavilions
of sublimity:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Hur and Kasur are concealed in the pavilions.”</p>

<p>The hand of men with an elegant and fanciful
conception has never reached, nor shall ever reach,
them.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Nobody has ever touched them before, neither men nor genii.”</p>

<p>For these Hur and Kaśur belong to men endowed
with sanctity and truth; as often as these perfect
personages approach them, they find also virgins,
and enjoy each time a pleasure such as they never
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pageno">160</span>
had before; because each time they meet with the
beginning of a new meaning, finer than the former,
although they obtain these objects before their death.</p>

<p>It has been stated by some sages that, when they
were intent upon some high undertaking, they
declared after its conclusion: “How can emperors
and their sons enjoy such a happiness,
which is still to be increased when all impediments
will be removed.” Know, men attached
to exterior evidence said, that whatever is commonly
believed of the last judgment, and what is connected
with the soul of the world, implies nothing else but
that, from the time when the Almighty God brought
forth out of nothingness into existence, the heavens,
the stars, the material bodies, the three kingdoms of
nature, and the essences, the duration of the world
shall extend to that period when he will again
plunge the whole into non-existence, and this shall
be “the other world.”</p>

<p>The learned say besides, that the composition of
the human body, and its conjunction with the soul,
make but one period of time, although birth and life
appear two distinct periods; the one comprising the
sensible and perceptible world, the other the rational
and intellectual world: for</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Whoever is not born twice, shall not enter at the same time into the
kingdom of heaven and that of the earth.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_120" id="fnanchor_120"></a><a href="#footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pageno">161</span>
This is the speech of the Lord Jesus, and with him
the present and the future world have also a twofold
signification, also both a particular and a common
one. As to the particular&mdash;there is something external
and internal in every one; body and soul in every
one; this is his present and future world. As to the
common signification&mdash;there is an external and an
internal world, that is, the material world is the present,
and the future is the internal world. As to
what is stated in the ostensible law, that the earth
has seven stories and the heaven also seven, the
interpretation of this is, that the earth is divided into
seven regions, whence is concluded that the heaven
also is divided into seven, separate from which they
account the <dfn>Kersi</dfn> or <dfn>Arsh</dfn>, that is the ninth heaven.
As to what is said, that on the day of resurrection
the heaven will be folded together,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On the day on which we shall fold the heavens, as the angel folds
the book (of good and bad actions of men), we shall replace them as
they were formed at the beginning of the creation. The heavens will
then be folded by his grace, power, and strength,”</p>

<p class="unindent"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pageno">162</span>
And the earth changed into another.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“One day we shall change this earth into another earth.”</p>

<p class="unindent">And after this change the earth and heaven will be
annihilated; the earth will be like pure silver, and
upon this earth no sin whatever will be committed:
in all this, the day of resurrection, heaven, and hell
are rendered present. As to what is asserted that
this earth will be changed into another&mdash;the Orientals
say, this is meant to relate to a vision which is
called the region of symbolic truth. And the rendering
present heaven and hell; this also refers to
an attribution of good and bad. Whoever assumes
the form of Hur or Kásur, serpent or scorpion, is
rendered happy or miserable. As to the transmutation
of the earth&mdash;this needs no interpretation: what
wonder is it that the culture of a region passes into
that of another country; and the passage from the
region of the sensible into that of allegory is evident
in the transformation of the folded heavens.
It has also been maintained that “the book of God”
is one thing, and “the word of God” another:
because the word is derived from the world<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_121" id="fnanchor_121"></a><a href="#footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></span>
of
commands, which has its purport from the invisible
and rational world; whilst the book is from the
world of creatures; that is, the material world; the
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pageno">163</span>
word, when written down, becomes a book; a command
which is brought to pass becomes an action;
and this is, with these believers, the meaning of the
words: <cite>Run fa yakun.</cite></p>

<p class="blockquote">“(God said) ‘Let it be,’ and it was.”</p>

<p>The world of command is devoid of contradiction
and multiplicity; it is pure in its essence but the
world of creatures contains contradiction and multiplicity,
and no atom of all atoms of beings is out of
the material world.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“There is nothing fresh or dry but in the true book (the Koran).”</p>

<p>Besides, the world of forms and of perceptible
things is to be considered as the book of God, and
every thing as a <dfn>Surah</dfn>, “a chapter,” of the Surahs
of this book; the alternation of days and nights, the
changes and alterations in the horizon and in the
phenomena are the vowel points of this book; the
days and nights of this book, Surah after Surah,
verse after verse, letter after letter, follow each
other, as in writing the lines are read in succession;
thus thou proceedest, from line to line and from letter
to letter, until thou findest the meaning which is
hidden in the subject of the words and expressions,
until thou knowest and renderest evident to thyself
the purport of the book:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“We shall show our verses (of the Koran) in the horizon (every where),
and in their souls, until it become evident to them that it is the
truth.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pageno">164</span>
And when thou understandest the book and hast
satisfied thy desire, certainly the book is then closed
and put out of thy hand.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On the day on which we shall fold the heavens, as the angel folds
the book&mdash;the heavens will then be folded by his grace, power, and
strength.”</p>

<p>And it was said, “On the right hand,” that it may
be manifest, that those who are at the left can have
no share in the possession of heaven.</p>

<p>The change of the earth is thus interpreted, that
mankind has two states: at first a terrestrial body
and a heavenly nature, subject to the dictates of
passion and of lust; and in this state all creatures
are in the troubles of imagination, and pride, and
conceitedness. Then takes place the first blast of
the trumpet for the sake of rest, in order that the
terrestrial, who are subject to the qualities of the
body, and the celestial, who possess those of a higher
nature, may both of them become dead to the troubles
of imagination, pride, and conceitedness, unless
a few of the qualities of the former state remain
alive; as this, on account of these very qualities,
may be indispensable by the power of necessity.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“And the trumpet was blown, and all the beings who were in heaven
and upon earth were troubled, except those whom God willed (that
they should not).</p>

<p>The second blast of the trumpet will be for recalling
all men to life, so that the terrestrial, who are
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pageno">165</span>
endowed with the qualities of nature, may resuscitate
from the death of ignorance and the sleep of
heedlessness, and rise up; that they may avert their
face from material objects and bodily pleasures,
which are understood under the name “world,”
and devote themselves to reasonable pursuits and
spiritual enjoyments, which are essential, so as to
know every thing in its real nature: which is</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Then the trumpet shall be blown, and instantly they shall resuscitate,
and see.”</p>

<p>In this state, the body, world, and the nature of
reason and law, are broken.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The earth was illumed by the light of his Lord; he placed the books,
and he brought the prophets and the witnesses.”</p>

<p>Then the earth of darkness shall be changed into
the world of light, and the heaven of nature into the
sphere of spirits:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On the day on which the earth shall be changed for another earth,
as well as the heavens; and it shall then be known that there is but
one God, the Almighty.”</p>

<p>The obscuration of the stars, and the extinction
of the sun’s and the moon’s light are interpreted,
that the stars signify the external and internal
senses, each of which is in its corresponding sign in
heaven; the spirit of animals and the light of the
moon are referred to the light of the soul; as the human
soul has in fact no light of its own, but solicits
an abundant loan of it from the sun of reason, and
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pageno">166</span>
diffuses it according to its own deficiency. It is said,
that when the human soul manifests itself, then
sensuality remains out of its action;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“When the stars shall be obscured;”</p>

<p>And when the light of reason breaks forth, then the
human soul also is dismissed from its action, and
when the benefitted unites with the benefactor, then
an incomparable form shows its face;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“He reunited the sun and the moon.”</p>

<p>And when the light of God shines forth, that is,
when “knowledge is infused,” which is equivalent
to revelation, manifesting itself, then reason and sight
are removed from the action, which they call</p>

<p class="blockquote">“When the sun shall be folded up.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_122" id="fnanchor_122"></a><a href="#footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></span>
</p>

<p>There are fifty stations in the field of judgment:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Present is the Creator and the master;</div>
  <div class="i0">At every station another question;</div>
  <div class="i0">Whoever gives his answer with justness</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall reach his station with rapidity.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The stations are in their order as follows: five
external and five internal senses; seven powers of
passion and lust; three spirits of nature, that is, of
minerals, vegetables, and animals; four humors;
three kingdoms of nature; four elements; eight
temperatures; seven forms of imagination; the other
four will be stated on another occasion.</p>

<p><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pageno">167</span>
The book of God signifies knowledge. As to the
last judgment and the resurrection of bodies, intelligent
men said, that each atom of the atoms of a
human body, which are dispersed, will be all collected
on the day of resurrection, and restored to
life, and at this hour there will be no question put
about any thing done, but what is come to us from
the prophets and saints, this we must believe. The
learned say besides, that the question is here about
the soul, which on the day of resurrection returns
(to its origin), and this substance is pure, and
does not require to be suitable to any dimension,
color, or place, but is independent of all these,
and on that account fit for sciences and knowledge
of all things; its extreme excellence is to be able to
collect for review all things from the first origin to
the last extremity, and to know that whenever it
attains that degree of perfection, it has returned to
the place of its origin; and this is the knowledge of
purity, which is remote from the defilement and
mixture of what is material. The learned assert besides,
that <em>the night of power</em>, “the night on which
the Koran was sent down,” refers to the beginning,
and the day of resurrection to the place
to which one returns; because the nature of night
is to conceal things of which few may have information,
and the nature of day is to bring to
view things of which all may take notice. Further,
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pageno">168</span>
the whole of the notions and powers of primitive
creation is contained in the knowledge of God, who
is understood under the name of “primitive, permanent,
and predestinator.” Every body possesses
not this knowledge; it was then on account
of the belief that the predestinations were concealed
in it, that “the night of power” was said to be
“primitive,” and as in the place to which one returns
(that is at the resurrection) every thing concealed
shall become manifest, and every one be informed
of it, on account of this belief, this place was
referred to “day.” As on this day, all are to rise
from the tomb of the body, and to awake from the
sleep of heedlessness, it was called “the resurrection.”</p>

<p>According to the learned, Kâbah (the square temple
at Mecca) is an emblem of the sun, on which
account it is right to worship it; and the well <span class="title">Zem
zem</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_123" id="fnanchor_123"></a><a href="#footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></span> signifies likewise “the great luminary,” as
<span class="person">Hakím Khákání</span> said relatively to both:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“O Kábah, thou traveller of the heaven!</div>
  <div class="i0">O Zem zem, thou fire of the world!”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><dfn>Hajer ul ásvad</dfn>, “the black stone at Mecca,” represents
the body of Venus, which on the border of the
heavens is a star of the planets. Some have interpreted
the resurrection of the bodies in the sense of
the learned, who referred it to the revolution of the
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pageno">169</span>
heavens, and to the influences of the stars upon the
terrestrial globe.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Every external form of things, and every object which disappeared,</div>
  <div class="i2">Remains stored up in the storehouse of fate;</div>
  <div class="i0">When the system of the heavens returns to its former order,</div>
  <div class="i0">God, the All-Just, will bring them forth from the veil of mystery.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Another poet says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“When the motion of the heavens in three hundred and sixty thousand years,</div>
  <div class="i0">Shall have described a minute about its centre,</div>
  <div class="i0">Then shall be manifest what had been manifest before,</div>
  <div class="i0">Without any divergence to the right or to the left.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The great revolution with them, according to the
word of <span class="person">Berzasp</span>, the disciple of Tahamúers, is of
three hundred and sixty thousand solar years: that
is, as the motions of the heavens take place in a circle,
their positions are necessarily determined; when,
according to that revolution, the positions of the
heavens manifest themselves so that from the contiguities,
the <dfn>adwár</dfn> and <dfn>ikwár</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_124" id="fnanchor_124"></a><a href="#footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></span>
“the cycles,” the <dfn>zatk</dfn>
and <dfn>fatk</dfn>, “the shutting and opening,” from the
conjunctions of the whole and from the unions, all
parts of the phenomena show the very same necessarily
determined position, in its reality without
increase and decrease. In the books of the Persian
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pageno">170</span>
sages is stated that, as the motions of the heavens are
circular, certainly the compasses return to the same
point from which the circumference began to be
drawn, and when at a second revolution the compasses
run over the same line upon which the former
circumference was drawn, undoubtedly, whatsoever
has been granted in the former circumference, shall
be granted again; as there is no disparity between
two circumferences, there will be no disparity between
their traces; because the phenomena, having
returned to that order in which they were found in
the beginning, the stars and heavens, having made
their revolution about the former centre, the distances,
contiguities, appearances, and relations having
in no aspect been contrary to the former aspects,
certainly the influences which manifested themselves
from yonder origin shall in no manner be different.</p>

<p>This is called in Persian <span class="trans">mahín cherkh</span>, “the great
circle;” and in Arabic <span class="trans">dawrah-i kabra</span>.</p>

<p>Fárábi<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_125" id="fnanchor_125"></a><a href="#footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></span>
says: the vulgar form to their own sight
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pageno">171</span>
their belief according to the shape of their imagination,
and will continue to form it so, and the place
of their imaginations will be a body of the heavenly
bodies. The venerable Shaikh Maktul tends to
establish in his demonstrations, that the heavenly
bodies are places of imaginations of the inhabitants
of heaven, and that beneath the heaven of the moon,
and above the globe of fire is a spherical body, without
motion, and this is the place of the imaginations
of the inhabitants of hell.</p>

<p>It is to be known, that this sect hold the world to
be eternal, and say that, as the sun’s light is to the
heaven, so is the world to God. Nothing was that
had not been, and nothing will be that is not. Further,
according to the expounders of theological
law, the world is a phenomenon of time. The philosophers
assert, the meaning of that phenomenon
is “procreation;” and the phenomenon of procreation
is not contradictory to “permanency;” infinite
permanency coalesces with time.</p>

 I shall attempt to sketch, in the smallest possible compass, the
fundamental ideas of Asiatic cosmology, which are rather confusedly
stated in the text.</p>

<p class="footnote">According to the Dasatir, God created primitively, immediately, and
singly, <dfn>the supreme intelligence</dfn>; this produced the <dfn>second intelligence</dfn>,
with the primitive soul and body; the second intelligence brought forth
the third, and the corresponding heavenly sphere, with soul and body;
and so down to the tenth intelligence, to wit that of <dfn>human reason</dfn>. The
modern Orientals kept the first-born supreme intelligence, which to the
Muhammedans was sanctified by the verse of the Koran, saying: <cite>The first
being which God created was intelligence</cite>, and established a double
series of descending intelligences and ascending heavenly spheres, as

<p class="footnote">The difference between the system of the Dasatir and the latter consists
only in this: that the first enthrones the first supreme intelligence, or
reason, above all nine heavenly spheres, and assigns to the second intelligence
with its soul and body the ninth sphere, in which the latter system
places the first intelligence, and the third intelligence corresponds to
the eighth sphere, and so on; each intelligence is placed in the first system,
one sphere higher than in the latter; so that the numbers of intelligences
and spheres, counterparts of each other, do not form a perfect

angels in the form of men. But, on the day of universal judgment, all

<span class="sc">Section II.&mdash;Of the Reputation and the Truth of
the prophetic Dignity.</span></p>

<p>Know that, when individuals of mankind want
to associate in the concerns of life, they find it indispensable
to have recourse to customs, regulations,
and religious faith, in order that they may
be concordant, and that oppression may be excluded
from their transactions and associations, and
the order of the world preserved. It is requisite
to refer the customs and regulations to God, and
to proclaim that they proceed from God, in order
that all may adopt them. On that account the necessity
of theology and of a prophetic mission became
evident, in order that the institutes for the government
of the creatures may be established, and, by
means of mildness and severity, men might be induced
to be concordant, and the different conditions
of the world arranged. And such an institutor is
named “illustrious sage;” his precepts are likewise
celebrated; among the eminent moderns, his title is
that of “prophet,” or “legislator,” and that of his
precepts “the law.” But his deputy, who is a
judge, ought to be a person distinguished by divine
grace, that he may promote the instruction and arrange
the affairs of mankind; such a man is called
by the wise “an universal ruler,” and his precepts
are entitled “the practice of the empire;” the moderns
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pageno">173</span>
gave him the name of <span class="title">Imám</span>, and to his precepts
that of <span class="title">Imámet</span>. The unusual customs, which
are called <dfn>mâjazát</dfn>,’ “miracles,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_126" id="fnanchor_126"></a><a href="#footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></span>
and <dfn>kirámát</dfn>, “prodigies,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_127" id="fnanchor_127"></a><a href="#footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></span>
have been submitted to investigations
from which it results that the vital spirit, or soul, is
the cause of the accidents which are manifested in
our body, such as anger and violent emotion. It
may be that the vitality attains such a force in every
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pageno">174</span>
manner, that its relation to this world of depravity
becomes of that nature as is our relation to our own
bodies: then its desire proves the cause of the accidents;
it brings about what it wishes in this world.
On that account, all the learned agree on this point,
that, in every respect, the soul is of an extreme
ingenuity and sagacity, so that, of whatsoever kind
the knowledge may be to which it turns its attention,
it renders itself master in one day of the whole
science, and the power of its memory is such, that it
recollects whatever it has heard but once, and, to
whatsoever object it directs its look, the soul will
give an account of it, of the past as well as of the
present. Another power of the soul is to know,
either in a dream or by <dfn>ilhám</dfn>, “inspiration,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_128" id="fnanchor_128"></a><a href="#footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></span>
an
event before it takes place. A further power of the
soul is, to discover the purport of whatever it sees.
All this together is the attribute of the soul. When,
on account of pious austerity and struggles in the
cause of God, one’s sensual spirit is kept in due temperature,
it becomes like an essence of heaven, and
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">175</span>
his rational soul borrows as much as possible from
the heavenly spirit, in the same manner as a polished
mirror receives the image from a painted surface.
Whatever comes forth from the rational soul in the
way of generality, of that the rational soul gives an
account by means of images in the way of particularity,
and brings it home to common sense by way
of allegories. And when comprehended by common
sense, it becomes evident, and there is no difference
between what comes to common sense from the
exterior or from the interior; on which very account
some have entitled it the <em>common</em> sense, as
being sensible from both sides. Further, he whose
constitution is better tempered, and whose power
of imagination and common sense is brighter, he,
after being freed from worldly dependencies, will
possess a righter fore-knowledge, such as that in
sleep: for sleep also is suitable to prescience, and
the revelation of some prophets was received during
sleep.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Upon the meaning of Revelation and Inspiration.</span></p>

<p>Some of the novices who feel themselves in this
state, comprehend at once something which they
did not understand before; they suppose they are
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">176</span>
as if hearing something from within, and this they
call “a voice from an invisible speaker.” It has
been said that, in miracles and supernatural events,
there is no doubt of our spirit being the phenomenon&mdash;which
manifests itself in the human body from men,
tal excitement and exultation; then it may happen
that the spirit receives such a force and perfection,
that its relation to the world of corruption be like
our relation to the body whence its desire may be
the mover in this exterior world.</p>

<p>There is another wonderful science and property
of things. The lord Shaikh Abu Alí<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_129" id="fnanchor_129"></a><a href="#footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></span>
says in his
book, “the Ascent to Heaven:” All the spirits are
subject to more perfect intelligences, except “the
Holy Ghost,” who is the mediator between the
self-existing Being and the first intelligences, and
this is “the command;” and the word of God means
“the revelation,” which the Holy Ghost makes by
the intervention of perfect intelligences, and which
is manifested by the prophetic spirit; whence, whatever
is the speech of the prophet, all is the expression
of the word of God, and his word is futile by
itself, and the name of holiness comes from God
alone.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="p2 center"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pageno">177</span>
<span class="sc">Upon the Interpretation of the Miracles of the
Prophet.</span></p>

<p>The learned possess a great number of versions
on this subject, but the best of all interpretations
is that of the lord raís, the wise Abu Alí Síná, who
declares: “So said the prophet of God, Muhammed,
the selected (peace be upon him):<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_130" id="fnanchor_130"></a><a href="#footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></span>
“One night I
slept in the house of my father’s sister;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_131" id="fnanchor_131"></a><a href="#footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></span>
it was a
night of thunder and lightning; no animal uttered
a sound; no bird was singing; no man was awake;
and I slept not, but was suspended between sleep
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pageno">178</span>
and waking: the secret meaning of this might
have been, that it was a long while before I became
desirous of understanding the divine truth. Under
the shield of the night, men enjoy greater freedom,
as the occupations of the body and the dependence
of the senses are broken. A sudden
night fell then, and I was still between sleep and
waking; that is, between reason and sensuality.
I fell into the sea of knowledge; and it was a night
with thunder and lightning, that is, the seven
upper agents prevailed, so that the power of human
courage and the power of imagination sunk
from their operation, and inactivity manifested its
ascendancy over activity. And lo! Jabrííl came
down in a beautiful form, with much pomp, splendor,
and magnificence, so that the house became
illuminated; that is, the power of the holy spirit
came upon me in the form of the command, and
made such an impression upon me, that all the
powers of the rational soul were renewed and
enlightened by it. And what the prophet said
in the description of Jabrííl, “to have seen him
whiter than snow, with a lovely face, black hair,
and on his forehead the inscription: ‘There is no
God but one God;’ the light of his eyes charming,
the eyebrows fine, having seventy thousand
curls twisted of red rubies, and six hundred thousand
pearls of a fine water,” that is, he possessed
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pageno">179</span>
so many beauties in the eyes of pure reason, that
if an impression of these beauties was made upon
a sense, it was able to perceive those which have
been described, and the purport of the words:
“there is no God but one God,” appeared in a
determined light: that is he whose eyes fall upon
his perfections is removed from the darkness of
infidelity, and doubt, and worldly connection;
and in such a manner he feels himself fortified in
the certitude of the Creator, and attains such a
degree of virtue, that hereafter, upon whatsoever
creature he looks, his faith in God’s unity will be
enhanced by it. And such were the charms of
the angel that, if one possessed seventy thousand
curls, he would not attain to his beauty; and such
was his rapidity, that thou wouldst have said, he
was flying with six hundred wings and arms, so
that his progress knew neither space nor time.”
“What he said came upon me, and he took me to
his bosom, and gave me kisses between the eyes,
and said: ‘O thou sleeper, how long sleepest
thou? rise!’ That is, when the power of holiness
came upon me, it caressed me, opened the
road of its revelation, and exalted me; a certain
delight which I cannot describe diffused itself in
my heart, and transported me to devotion. The
angel then continued: ‘How long sleepest thou?’
that is ‘why indulgest thou in the delusions of
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">180</span>
falsehood? thou art attached to the world, and,
as long as thou remainest in it, and before thou
awakest, knowledge cannot be obtained; but I,
from compassion towards thee, shall be thy
guide on the road. Rise.’ I trembled at his
words, and from fear jumped up from my place:
that is, from timid respect for him no reflection
remained in my heart and mind. He further said:
‘Be calm, I am thy brother, Jabrííl;’ thus, by his
kindness and revelation, my terror was appeased.
But he unfolded more of his mysteries, so that
fear returned upon me. I then said: ‘O brother,
I feel the hand of an enemy.’ He replied:
‘I shall not deliver thee into the hand of an enemy.’
I asked: ‘Into whose?’ He answered:
‘Rise, and be glad, and keep thy heart within
thyself:’ that is, preserve thy memory clear,
and show obedience to me, until I shall have
removed the difficulties before thee. And
as he spoke I became entranced and transported,
and I proceeded on the footsteps of Jabrííl;
that is, I forsook the sensual world, and by the
aid of natural reason I followed the footsteps of
holy grace.” What the prophet said: “I saw
“Borák upon the footsteps of Jabrííl,” signifies,
the practical reason which triumphs by means of
the power of sanctity, and by its assistance gains
the ascendancy over this world of corruption: for
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pageno">181</span>
from the heavenly intelligences proceeds practical
reason, which is the supreme king and assistant of
the soul, at any time when it may be required. It
is to be compared to Borak for this reason, because
it was the illuminator of the night, and the vehicle of
the protector, who on that journey wanted it: on
that account the prophet called it <span class="title">Borák</span>. And as to
what he further said: “It was greater than an ass
“and smaller than a horse;” this means, it was
greater than human reason, but smaller than the
first intelligence. And “Borak’s face was like that
“of a man,” signifies, he had a propensity for human
order and much kindness for men, as a family
by its manner and likeness among men has a bearing
to kindness and arrangement. What the prophet
stated of “a long hand and long foot,” means
that his benefit extends to all places, and that his
bounty keeps all things new. What he stated: “I
wanted to mount Borák, but he resisted until
Jabrííl gave assistance; then he became obedient
to me;” this implies, I was under the influence of
the corporeal world; I desired to associate with reason;
but this was refused until the power of sanctity
washed off by a bath the entanglement of ignorance
and the hinderances of the body, so that I became
pure, and by such means attained the bounty and
advantage of practical reason.</p>

<p>What the prophet further said: “When I proceeded
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">182</span>
on the way,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_132" id="fnanchor_132"></a><a href="#footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></span>
and had left the mountains
of Mecca, I saw a wanderer following my steps,
who called out: ‘Stop!’ But Jabrííl said: ‘Hold
no conversation; go on.’ I went on.” By this
the power of the imgination is indicated; that is:
when I became free of the sight of my limbs and
every thing belonging to me, and yielding no more
to sensuality, and thus proceeded, the power of imagination,
upon my steps, called out to me to stop;
for the power of imagination is dextrous, and certainly
is great, exerting itself in all affairs, and
serves in lieu of intellect to all animals; but it is not
right to allow imagination too much liberty, because
it then descends to an equality with animals, and
disorders its noble nature; further, whoever is assisted
by the grace of God, follows not, on all occasions,
the imagination. As to what the prophet
said: “Behind me called out a woman, deceitful
and beauteous: ‘Stop until I join thee!’ Jabrííl
also said: ‘Go on, and beware of stopping:’” this
means the power of imagination, which is deceitful
and bedecked, resembling a woman, to whom most
natures are inclined, and who keeps men in her
bondage; besides, whatever she does, is all art,
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>
without foundation, and contaminated by fraud and
deception; nay, the very business of women is artifice
and fiction: the power of imagination is not
otherwise seductive. To continue: the lies and false
promises of women being so many lures, they
render mankind their slaves with their show, and
never keep their faith; so that all they affect turns
out to be futile. Thus, when a man follows the
steps of imagination, he never attains true intelligence,
as he always remains upon the track of outward
ornament and in the bondage of corporeal
appearance, without reality.</p>

<p>“And as to what the prophet stated: When I
went on, Jabrííl said: ‘If thou hadst waited until
she had joined thee, thou wouldst have become
a friend of the world,’” this means: that worldly
affairs are without reality, brittle and soon decaying,
and that worldly occupations have a value but in
conjunction with the views of a future state; inasmuch
as occurrences and appearances are a deception,
and are esteemed as adjuncts to the secrets of a
high intelligence; and whoever devotes himself to
the former rests behind the higher intelligences, and,
in the illusion of vanity, rests imprisoned in the pitfall
of ignorance.</p>

<p>And what Muhammed said: “When I left the
mountains and these two persons behind me, I
went on until I reached the house of sanctity
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">184</span>
(<dfn>Jerusalem</dfn>); and as I entered it, a person came to
me, and gave me three cups&mdash;the one of wine,
the second of water, and the other of milk. I
wished to take that of wine, but Jabrííl forbade it,
and pointed to that of milk, which I took and
drank:” the meaning of this is: When I freed
myself from sensuality, and knew the state of imagination
and deception, and resolved in myself to
enter the world of spirits, then I saw three spirits
in the house of sanctity&mdash;the one was that of animal
life, the second that of nature, and the other that of
rationality. I wished to proceed on the footsteps
of brutishness, and compared it to wine, the power
of which is seducing, clouding, and ignorance-increasing,
like passion and lust, and wine is the
darkener of the two other powers. And he compared
nature to water, because from it is derived the
support and stability of a person, and man depends
upon the temperament of the agents which act in
the body;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_133" id="fnanchor_133"></a><a href="#footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></span>
water is also the vital strength of animals,
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
and the promoter of growth and increase.
And the rational spirit he compared to milk, as
being a salutary and agreeable nourishment, and
promoting welfare. And as to what he said: “I
wished to take the wine; but he forbade it, that
I might take the milk:” is in allusion to most men,
who, being badly disposed, do not desist from obsequiousness
to two spirits, those of nature and brutishness;
and whoever is badly disposed demands
what is material, and the pleasure and enjoyment
of these two spirits are of this kind.</p>

<p>“The Prophet said farther: When I arrived
there I entered the mosque, and the crier called
to prayer; and I stepped forward, I saw an assembly
of prophets and angels standing to the right
and the left; every one saluted me, and made a
new covenant with me.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_134" id="fnanchor_134"></a><a href="#footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></span>
This means: When I became
freed from all converse and concern with brutishness
and nature, I entered the mosque, that is,
I retired into the inmost of the soul; by “crier of
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pageno">186</span>
the mosque” is understood the power of remembering
and praising God; by “one’s Imám,” meditation;
and “the angels” mean the powers of the
inmost soul, such as abstraction, memory, praise of
God, and the like. Further, “saluting them” refers
to the comprehending of all the mental powers.
Thus, when one wishes to mount up to the terrace
of a house, he must first have a staircase by which
he may, step after step, ascend, until he attains
the summit of the terrace; in like manner also are
these refined powers to be considered as ladder-steps,
upon which, the one after the other, a man
ascends until he arrives at his aim.</p>

<p>“And what the prophet said: When I became
free, I raised my face upwards, and I found a
ladder, one step of which was of silver and the
other of gold:”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_135" id="fnanchor_135"></a><a href="#footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></span>
this means, from the external to
the internal sense; “gold” and “silver” denote
the superior value of the one over the other.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_136" id="fnanchor_136"></a><a href="#footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pageno">187</span>
“And what he said: I arrived at the heaven of
the universe; the gates yielded and I entered.
There I saw Ismâíl seated upon a throne, and a
crowd before him, with their eyes fixed upon his
face. I made my salute, looked at him, and went
on.” By “heaven,” is understood the moon;
by “Ismâíl,” the body of the moon; and by “the
crowd,” those whose conditions are under the
influence of the moon.</p>

<p>“What Muhammed said: I entered the second
heaven;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_137" id="fnanchor_137"></a><a href="#footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></span>
there I saw an Angel excelling all others;
by his perfect beauty, he captivated the admiration
of the whole creation; one half of his body
was of ice and the other half of fire; and yet there
was no counteraction nor enmity between them.
He saluted me, and said: ‘Be welcome! All
things and riches are thine.’” This means: it
was the heaven of Mercury; and the import of this
is, that every star has a determined influence, either
auspicious or inauspicious; but Mercury acts in both
ways; with an inauspicious connection inauspiciously,
with an auspicious one auspiciously; so that
one half is good and the other half bad.” The
“welcome,” and the gift of “prosperity and riches,”
mean: the power of the mind, and the multiplicity
of sciences which the star bestows.</p>

<p><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pageno">188</span>
What the prophet said: “When I arrived into
the third heaven,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_138" id="fnanchor_138"></a><a href="#footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></span>
I there saw an Angel, equal to
whom in excellence and beauty I had seen none;
placid and joyful, he was seated upon a throne;
and a circle of angelic effulgency was diffused
about him.” This was the heaven of Venus, and
it is not necessary to comment its beauty: it denotes
gladness and festivity.</p>

<p>Further: “When I entered the fourth heaven,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_139" id="fnanchor_139"></a><a href="#footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></span>
I there saw an Angel, surrounded with royal pomp,
seated upon a throne of light; I made my obeisance,
to which he replied with entire haughtiness,
and, from pride and majesty, he bestowed
neither word nor smile upon any body about
him. When he answered my salute, he said:
‘O Muhammed, I see all things and riches in
thee: glory and happiness to thee.’” That is,
“the fourth heaven,” the residence of “this angel,”
means the sun; he represents the conditions of
kings and great personages; his “smile” is his influence
upon good fortune; and his “congratulation”
signifies his bounty for any body’s prosperity.</p>

<p>“In continuation: When I arrived at, and entered,
the fifth heaven,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_140" id="fnanchor_140"></a><a href="#footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></span>
I happened to have a view of
hell; and I saw a black region, and, on its borders
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">189</span>
was seated a terrific and dark Angel, who
was engaged in the business of punishing bad
men.” That is “the fifth heaven, with its angel,”
signifies “Mars;” this planet denotes the state of
criminals and of blood-shedding men; and by “hell”
is understood any account and description of the
conditions which are appropriated to them.</p>

<p>“Moreover, When I entered the sixth heaven,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_141" id="fnanchor_141"></a><a href="#footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></span>
I
saw an angel sitting upon a throne of light, occupied
with counting his prayers by beads, and with
uttering benedictions; he had wings, and curls
set with jewels, pearls, and rubies. I bowed before
him, to which he returned blessings and
congratulations, and wishes of joy and prosperity,
and said: ‘I give thee perpetual blessing.’” That
is, “the sixth heaven,” and “its angel,” signifies
“Jupiter;” and he relates to persons of rectitude,
abstinence and knowledge; his “wings and curls”
signify his light and rays; and his “blessings,” his
auspicious influence; for he bestows great felicity,
and all sorts of good prooceed from him.”</p>

<p>“To proceed: When I attained the seventh heaven,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_142" id="fnanchor_142"></a><a href="#footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></span>

I saw an angel seated upon a throne of red
rubies; not every one had access to him, but he
who approached him found a kind treatment. I
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">190</span>
made my reverence, and he returned an answer
by blessing me.” This is understood to be “the
seventh heaven,” and “that angel” was Saturn.
He is averse to greatness; but, whatever impression
he makes is perfect and entire; and when he shows
favor it is greater than any other; “every one cannot
approach him:” that is, it happens seldom
that one falls in with a fortunate situation, but, if it
occurs, the happy result is such as to surpass all
others.</p>

<p>“In sequel: When I proceeded,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_143" id="fnanchor_143"></a><a href="#footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></span>
I arrived at the
heavenly mansion of the angel Jabrííl; I saw a
world full of light and splendor, and such was
the effulgency that my eyes were dazzled. To
the right or left, to whatever side I turned my
looks, they met with angelic spirits, engaged in
devotion. I said: ‘O Jabrííl, who are this class
of beings?’ He answered: ‘these know of no
other fixed business but praying, counting their
beads, and visiting churches.’”</p>

<p class="blockquote"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pageno">191</span>
“There is for him, on the other side, but one place known.”</p>

<p>“By the ‘eighth heaven’ is understood the heaven
of the fixed stars, and there are the constellations;
“the churches” mean the twelve signs of the
zodiac; each community of them inhabits a determined
side; they do not combat each other, as the
southern have no business with the northern, and
each has his fixed situation: some of the constellations
are in the zodiac, some to the south, and others
to the north.</p>

<p>“Besides, the prophet said: I saw five mansions
greater than any thing else, which spread
their shade over earth and heaven.” He denotes
here the great heaven, which in its interior incloses
all the other heavens, and is the greatest of all
spaces.</p>

<p>Again, saying: “When I proceeded, I saw four
seas, the waters of each being of a different color,”
he implies an account of essentiality, corporeity, materiality,
and exteriority; inasmuch as this account
is generally perplexing, the idea of every one being
conceived in a different way, and each way interpreted
by every one.</p>

<p>And what the prophet said: “I saw angels much
occupied with beads and prayers and all taken up
with the precious sentence, <cite>There is no God but one
God</cite>:” this refers to pure spirits who are free from
matters of desire, and spotless; and every man who
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pageno">192</span>
is remote from the world, wise, pure, and disengaged
from all ties, when he separates from the body, is
transported by God Almighty to the place and mansion
of angels, and invested with everlasting beatitude.
And the prophet assimilated him with angels,
because they are seats of purity and devotion; that
is, remote from corruption and perdition, and from
the disturbance of sensuality, intent upon avoiding
anger, and raised to the dignity of angels, perpetually
engaged in the exploration of secret knowledge;
they likewise never look upon the nether world, because,
the body being in conjunction with mean and
noble spirits, when a person fixes his sight upon low
stations, he becomes liable to feel the attaint of necessity,
and to search for expediency among circumstances;
but when he effects his separation from
them, he attains the noble perfection of himself, he
becomes beatified, and immersed in delight and tranquillity,
in such a manner that he never throws a
look upon the inferior world, because, this bodily
form being taken off from him, he then, by increase
of knowledge and comprehension, acquires dignity
and nobleness.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Some are upon their knees, and some prostrate themselves.”</p>

<p>Some are spiritual, some praisers of God, some
bent before him, some holy, and some purified
cherubim, conforming in customs, lords, and
princes.</p>

<p><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">193</span>
“Still more: When I left this assembly, in my
progess I arrived at a sea without borders; howsoever
I strained my sight, I could not perceive
any boundary or shore; and at this sea I saw a
river, and an angel who was pouring the seawater
into the river, and from thence the water
ran to every place.” By “the sea,” he implies
the first intelligence; and by “the river,” the first
spirit.</p>

<p>“Likewise: On the level of that sea, I perceived
a great desert, greater than which I had never
seen any space, so that, in spite of my endeavor, I
found neither the beginning nor the end of it.”
That is: I could not assign a limit to what was more
extensive than any thing else, as the comprehension
of a pure being belongs only to a perfect intelligence.</p>

<p>“In continuance: On the level of the sea and the
desert, I saw an angel surrounded with every
grandeur, splendor, and pomp, who guarded both
halves with facility; he called me to him, and
having joined him, I asked: ‘What is thy name?’
He answered: ‘<span class="title">Mikáil</span>: I am the greatest of all
angels; whatever is difficult, ask it from me; and
whatever thou desirest, demand it from me: I will
satisfy all thy wishes.’” This means: When I had
learned and considered all this, I understood the
first command. And the Angel represents what is
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pageno">194</span>
called “the Holy Ghost,” and is said to be “a cherub.”
Whoever has access to him and receives
his assistance, evinces himself as wise, and participates
in spiritual enjoyments.</p>

<p>“And also: When I had set myself free from
saluting and questioning, I said: ‘To arrive at
this place I experienced much trouble, and my
purpose in coming here was to attain knowledge,
and the sight of God Almighty. Grant
me guidance, that I may satisfy my desire, and
then return home.’” That is: by the pure
command, which is the holy word, he wished that,
as, after the study of nature, his inward sight was
opened to clear evidence, he might behold every
thing such as it was; he wished that he might find
the absolute Being, the first cause, the self-existing
necessary Being, the supreme good; and that he
might know his unity so that in him multiplicity
cannot exist.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_144" id="fnanchor_144"></a><a href="#footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“What the prophet further said: That angel
took me by the hand,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_145" id="fnanchor_145"></a><a href="#footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></span>
and gave me a passage
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pageno">195</span>
through several thousand curtains into a world,
where I saw nothing like what I had seen before,
until he brought me at last near the Lord of glory;
then the command came to me: ‘Approach.’”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_146" id="fnanchor_146"></a><a href="#footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></span>
This means: that the holy God is exempt from body,
substance, and wants, which are found in this world.</p>

<p><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">196</span>
“Again: In that majesty I immersed my sense
and motion, and found entire relaxation, contentment
and tranquillity.” That is: I acquired such
a knowledge of his purity and of his beneficence,
as no living being can comprehend with his sense:
for he may have a clear perception of bodies, and
observe forms and images; a substance <em>endowed with</em>
a memorial intelligence conceives ideas; but the self-existent,
necessary Being is out of this category,
and cannot be understood by sense, imagination,
and memorial power; in his majesty there is no
motion, because motion is a change of existence;
but the self-existent necessary Being is such as to be
the mover of all things.</p>

<p>“The prophet said further: From fear of the
Lord I forgot all things I had seen and known
before, and I felt such an exaltation, inspiration,
and inward delight, that thou wouldst have
said: ‘I am intoxicated.’” That is: When my
intelligence found access to the knowledge of unity,
I considered and investigated the parts, and from
this study the rational soul derived such enjoyment,
that all the powers of brutishness and nature
desisted from their action, and such an immersion
into unity manifested itself, that there remained no
consideration for the science relative to substance
and bodies.</p>

<p>“Again: I felt some impressions of God’s proximity,
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">197</span>
so that I was seized with trembling; and I
heard the command: ‘Proceed,’ and I proceeded.
Then came the word: ‘Fear not nor be disquieted.’”
This means: When I was initiated in the
mystery of unity, I learned that the self-existent necessary
Being is without the divisions of this world; I
trembled at the boldness of my journey, which had
attained such a height and distance; and I apprehended
failing in the proof of the unity; but I heard
the words: “Come nearer;” that is: dismiss thy
pondering, fear, and terror; for such is the proper
state of a believer in the unity of God, to be continually
immersed in a spiritual ecstacy, so that he may
never fall back into the disgrace of brutishness, and
fear and hope belong to the state of brutishness.</p>

<p>“Moreover: I drew nearer, and upon me came
the blessing of the Lord, such as I never had
heard before;” that is: I received the revelation,
the true words of the self-existent, necessary Being:
and his speech is not like that of creatures by letters
and sounds; no! his speech is evidence of knowledge,
by itself pure, communicating to the spirit what he
wills in a universal not a particular way.</p>

<p>“Further: The command came: ‘Say thy prayer:’
I replied: I cannot; for thou art thyself such as
thou hast said.” This means: When he was able
to perceive the excellence of the belief in the unity of
God, he found the truth of the words of the self-existing
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pageno">198</span>
necessary Being; he then felt such delight
as he had never experienced before; he knew that
the self-existing necessary Being is worthy of all
prayers, but he felt at the same time that he could
not express his prayers with the tongue, because an
arrangement of letters is required for every thing
which falls from the tongue, but that which has no
connection except that of parts and the whole, is
not suitable to the true, necessary, and self-existing
Being, as he is not conceivable, either in parts or in
a whole. The prophet knew that his prayer could
not properly come from the tongue, as it is no business
of the senses, but belongs properly to reason;
but reason knew that an object highly deserving to
be praised requires a praiser worthy of it, one whose
knowledge may be adequate to the power of the
being to be praised, so that the speech may prove
suitable to the intention. The self-existent necessary
Being is an object of unity without an equal,
therefore the praise of any one will never be worthy
of him. Besides, the prophet trusted also to God’s
knowledge, for he is all knowledge, and the knowledge
of him is the theme of prayers to his being
without letters and sound, and not by reason: he
himself is his own ornament; he himself is his eloquence.</p>

<p>What the prophet further said: “The word
came to me: ‘What dost thou wish?’ I said:
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pageno">199</span>
‘Leave to ask whatever comes into my mind, so
that my difficulties may be removed.’” This
means: that when God asked: “What dost thou
wish,” and I said “leave,” it was knowledge I
wished: because in this journey no other consideration
but that of pure reason had remained, which
was to approach the majesty of the self-existent
Being, and to understand his unity, which cannot
be obtained but by the gift of knowledge. The prophet
wished to be rendered worthy of him, and by
full knowledge to acquire the dignity required, that
he might then exhibit every difficulty that occurred,
and receive a categorical answer. For the guidance
of mankind, he composed the rules of the law in
words which came suitably to the ears of men, so
that at the same time the meaning of them was fixed,
and the veil of advice remained upon such things as
are not required <em>to be known</em>; what proved also an
assistance to that knowledge, was the journey, consequently
to which the law was given, and the account
of which was drawn up for publication in
such a manner, that the sense of it was obvious to
none but to the investigators of truth.</p>

<p>The prophet also said: “When I had performed all this,
and returned home, on account of the
rapidity of my journey, I found the bed-clothes
still warm.” That is: he performed a journey
of reflection, and travelled with his mind; the purpose
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">200</span>
of this voyage was, by the consideration of the
created beings to attain at the self-existent necessary
Being; and when he had completed his mental task,
he returned back into himself; he needed not a day
for this business, but in less than in the twinkling of
an eye recovered his former state; whoever knows,
understands why he went; and whoever knows not,
looks in vain for an expedient. It is not right to communicate
these words to an ignorant or low person,
because the enlightened alone can enjoy this fruit.”</p>

<p>So far the words of the example of the wise, the
Shaikh Abú-âlí Sína.</p>

<p>In the book of the investigators of truth is to be
found, and from the tongue of the intelligent the
information has been received, that the moon is one
of the archangels, and cherubim of God. Being a
celestial body, he cannot be cleft, and the supremacy
of his power is not subject to absurd changes of
form, nor does he undergo them. Conseqently, the
fissure of the moon, which is mentioned in the Koran,
is an evident allegory, the sense of which is
obvious; because every star and sphere has an internal
foundation, called “reason,” so that of the
moon among all bears the title of “superior wisdom.”
It is also established in the fundamentals
of the philosophers among this sect, that the utmost
dignity and perfection of man, attributable to corporeity,
is that which unites and coalesces into one,
<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pageno">201</span>
“with superior wisdom;” whoever attains that degree,
comprehends also any other to which he may
proceed, without any new study for it; and no degree
of human perfection and no knowledge is excluded
from it. Hence, whenever this matter is understood,
the fissure of the moon typifies nothing else
but renunciation of the external for the internal,
which is the “superior wisdom.” As the lord prophet
(the peace of God be upon him!) is the master
of the lunar sphere, to cleave (or divide) the moon
means to attain to the innermost recess of the moon.
But this creed belongs to the learned of the <dfn>Masháyin</dfn>,
“peripatetics;” the <span class="title">Ishrákían</span> say, the true solution
of this enigma is contained in their fundamental
science; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: light is the type of the primitive creation
of the world, and they divided whatever is contained
in it, in two parts: the first is a light, in
which there is not the least mixture of obscurity and
darkness, proper to corporeal matter; the second
sort of light can be mixed with some material darkness.
The first sort of light, pure in a general and
real acceptation, originates from primitive matter,
and, according to their showing, emerged absolutely
free from parts; but the second sort of light is mixed
with obscurity, and throws rays on all sides; its
knowledge can be comprehended by generalities
and particularities, whence by its power it passes into
action. In their metaphysics it is also settled, that
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pageno">202</span>
the furthermost stretch and connection of beings, and
the utmost term of completion, consist in this, that
knowledge, may become manifest in the whole by
generalities and particularities, so that nothing may
remain deficient in any degree of power. Whenever
this matter is settled, then the moon in their
language signifies a mixed light, with this property,
that it brings into action all the knowledge hidden in
its efficacy, and by means of the reflection of rays
elicits perfection.</p>

<p>Whoever is well founded in these notions acquires
the faculty that all sciences, whatsoever they may be,
come forth from him. It is then the moon which
signifies mixed light, and the rending asunder of it
means the arising of sciences and excellence, and
their manifestation; that is, bringing forth all that is
within, by means of breaking its exterior form.</p>

<p>As to fixing the seal of the prophetic office, and
to completing the apostleship, so that after the prophet
of Arabia no other may appear, they said what
follows: The seal of the prophetic office means the
acquisition of <dfn>âkl fâal</dfn>, “superior wisdom;” that
is: whoever obtains it, and makes the proper use of
it, possesses the seal of the prophetic office: because
the first prophetic dignity is his intelligence, which
is the <dfn>real (intrinsic) Adam</dfn>, “man.” The prophetic
seal is the tenth rank of intelligences,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_147" id="fnanchor_147"></a><a href="#footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></span>
and that
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pageno">203</span>
which is reared up by superior wisdom renders the
prophet’s knowledge vain, and takes his color: that
is to say, if one hundred thousand prophets like himself
realise in themselves the person of superior
wisdom, they are possessors of the seal, the last
prophets, because it is superior wisdom, which is
the seal, and they know themselves to be <dfn>mahu</dfn>,
“effaced,” and superior wisdom to be existing.</p>

<p>But the Ashrákían say, that the first prophet is
the majesty of the <em>cherubic light</em>, that is the first intelligence,
and <em>the possessor of the prophetic seal</em> is the
Lord God of the human race, that is, the intelligence
which legislates the human race. Further,
whoever found grace with the Lord of mankind,
and became his near attendant, his <span class="title">Káim makám</span>,
“vice-regent,” although the authority of such a
person be vain by itself <em>as delegate</em>, yet he, too, is
called <span class="title">the possessor of the prophetic seal</span> (the last prophet):
so, as Azizi said:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“From head to foot, my person became my friend: hence, if I wish</div>
  <div class="i0">To see the friend, I place the mirror before me.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Kásam Khan said:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“I will in such a manner make myself one with thee, that if one day</div>
  <div class="i0">Thou seekest thyself, thou mayest find me within thy tunic.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>As to the interpretation of what they say, that the
prophet had no shade&mdash;this refers to an able son:
as after Muhammed (the peace of the Highest be
upon him!) the prophetic mission did not devolve
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pageno">204</span>
upon a son of his: hence the saying that he had no
shade. It is also said, that never a fly sat upon the
body of the prophet; which means that he never
was tainted by avarice.</p>

<p class="footnote">The Asiatic Doctors admit that extraordinary things may be operated
by men who pretend to be <span class="title">deities</span>, <span class="title">prophets</span>, <span class="title">Valis</span> (Saints, of whom more
hereafter), and <span class="title">magicians</span>, who are supposed to command demons. Thus
they quote Pharaoh, who arrogated divinity to himself, and performed
miracles, and thus it shall be with the Antichrist. Celestial favors granted
to Valis are believed by the orthodox Muhammedans, upon the strength of
the Koran and authentic traditions. To these are added innumerable
tales accredited among the superstitious, some of which are ingeniously
combined with a moral lesson. Jâmi, in his <cite>Lives of Sufis</cite>, quotes the
following words of another illustrious personage, whom he does not name:
“The principle on which all is comprised is, that, when a man performs
an extraordinary action, renouncing something which other men are
wont to do, or which he himself was wont to do, God also, on his
part, by a sort of compensation, changes, in that man’s favor, something
in the ordinary course of nature. It is that which the vulgar call
<span class="title">Kerámet</span>. But distinguished men understand by this word the divine
favor which gave a man aid and force to renounce the things to which
he was accustomed. This is what we understand by <span class="title">Keramet</span>.” This

 <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">الهام</span>, <dfn>ilhám</dfn>, means what is thrown in a man’s mind by way of

by way of thought and reflection. It is also explained, a knowledge which
rises in a man’s heart and excites him to action without his demanding a

He and Al Fárábi, before-mentioned (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 170, <a href="#footnote_125">note 1</a>) are, according
to the concurring opinions of the Arabs, the most distinguished chiefs
of the Arabian philosophers, properly so called. The logic of Avisenna

 The ascent of Muhammed to Heaven has been mentioned (vol. II.
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 339). The prophet gave no explicit account of it in the Koran, yet
traditions of what he himself had related of it, although not without
various versions, are preserved, and believed with equal faith as the verses
of the sacred book themselves, in which frequent allusions occur to the
circumstances and events of which Muhammed’s voyage to Heaven is
composed. These, indeed, however absurd they may appear to unbelievers,
contain the fundamentals of the Muhammedan mysticism. On
account of this importance, I shall add to the notice given above, by Avisenna,
some particulars contained in the narration published from original
sources by the Baron of Hammer Purgstal <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gemäldesaal moslimischer

 Muhammed was sleeping in the house of Omm Hani, the daughter of
Abu Thaleb, in the sanctuary of the Kâba, when Jabríl awakened him; the
angel called Mikail to bring him a cup full of water from the sacred well
Zemzem (see <abbr title="volume three pages">vol. III. pp.</abbr> 14-15. <a href="#footnote_12">note 1</a>). Jabríl cleft Muhammed’s
breast, drew his heart out, washed it, and, with three cups from the
sacred fountain, infused into him faith, knowledge, and wisdom. He
then conducted him out of the sanctuary to a place between Safa and
Merva, where he made the prophet bestride Borak (see <abbr title="volume Two page">vol. II. p.</abbr> 339),
which, as the Angel said, was mounted by Abraham.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_132" id="footnote_132"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_132"><span class="muchsmaller">[132]</span></a>
 The ride proceeded to Jerusalem; a troop of Angels surrounded
them on all sides. On the way Muhammed was called to successively by
two men, the one of whom was a Jew, the other a Christian, and by a
seductive female; the prophet did not stop at the voice of either.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_133" id="footnote_133"></a>

 This obscure passage appears to allude to a glose found in the
Desátir, English <abbr title="translation page">transl., p.</abbr> 183. After having said that there are four
elements, the Commentator subjoins: “The water is of the shape of a
ball, the half of which being broken, is filled with water, so that the
water and earth together compose one ball. And as the elements
penetrate into and affect each other, a sort of middle nature is produced,
which is called <dfn>constitution</dfn> or <dfn>temperament</dfn>. If a body that
is united with a temperament has the probability of subsisting for a
protracted time, and of retaining its compound substance, it is called
‘permanent,’ or ‘perfect;’ if not, ‘imperfect,’ or ‘wanting permanence.’”&mdash;Lower
down: “And there can be no temperament so
equalised that the elements in it should be exactly of the same quantity
and mode. And in proportion as a temperament more nearly
approaches equality, the soul bestowed on it by the Originator of being
is more perfect.”</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_134" id="footnote_134"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_134"><span class="muchsmaller">[134]</span></a>
 In the temple of Jerusalem, Muhammed was saluted by choirs of
angels and prophets, as the first of interceders before God, the last of
prophets, and as one who will assemble the people on the day of
judgment.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_135" id="footnote_135"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_135"><span class="muchsmaller">[135]</span></a>
 From the temple, the prophet was conducted by Jabrííl to the rock
upon which Abraham was ready to sacrifice his son Isaac. From them
rose a ladder to heaven; not only were the steps alternately of gold and
silver, but also, on one side shone edifices of emerald, and on the other
palaces of ruby.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_136" id="footnote_136"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_136"><span class="muchsmaller">[136]</span></a>
 Here Jabrííl took Muhammed upon his wings and flew with him to
the gate of Paradise, which was guarded by a legion of Angels. In the
first heaven he saluted Adam, who sat between two gates, and was looking
now to the right, now to the left; when to the right, he laughed, when
to the left, he wept; for the right hand led to heaven, the left to hell:
the first father’s joy or sadness followed his children going to either side.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_137" id="footnote_137"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_137"><span class="muchsmaller">[137]</span></a>
 In the second heaven, Muhammed saw Jesus and St. John at his
side. They returned his salute.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_138" id="footnote_138"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_138"><span class="muchsmaller">[138]</span></a>

 Jabrííl then conducted Muhammed to his own usual residence. There
was the heavenly lotus tree (the tree of knowledge), around which a
divine light was diffused, and legions of angels were ranged. Beneath
the roots of the tree four sources were flowing: the first, <dfn>Kawser</dfn>, spirituous,
like wine; the second, <dfn>Selsebil</dfn>, sweet, like clarified honey; the
third, <dfn>the source of mildness</dfn>, like the purest milk; and the fourth, <dfn>the
source of mercy</dfn>, like liquid crystal. Jabrííl offered to the prophet three
cups, made of diamond, saphir, and ruby; the first filled with honey, the
second with milk, the third with wine. The prophet tasted the first, drank
the second, and declined the third, in which he was approved by the angel.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_144" id="footnote_144"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_144"><span class="muchsmaller">[144]</span></a>
 I followed here the manuscript of Oude, which reads:
<span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">و شناسد وحدت او چنانکہ دروی کثرت نکنجد</span></p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_145" id="footnote_145"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_145"><span class="muchsmaller">[145]</span></a>
 From the mansion of Jabrííl they proceeded to the heavenly tabernacle,
called <dfn>baitúl mâmur</dfn>, “the house of delightful culture,” and
formed upon the model of the ancient Kâba, which, during the deluge,
was carried by angels up to heaven and placed perpendicularly above
the modern sanctuary of Mecca. Seventy thousand angels were always
going out and in to worship. In entering it, Jabrííl gave the precedence
to the prophet; they arrived at a golden veil, which the angel touched.
Here the Angels sang: “There is no God but God; and from behind the
veil the voice of God answered: “I am God, and no God exists but me.”
The Angels added: “Muhammed is the prophet of God;” and God confirmed
it by the words: “My servants say the truth; I have sent Muhammed
as my apostle.” Now, Muhammed was raised up by angelic hands;
Jabrííl remained behind. The prophet proceeded through seventy thousand
veils of light and darkness; each veil had the opacity of a thousand
years, and as many years separated the one from the other.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_146" id="footnote_146"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_146"><span class="muchsmaller">[146]</span></a>
 Now he had attained the green rail with green cushions, illumed
with a green light clearer than that of the sun. Muhammed was then
called to approach; he adored; saw the Lord in the most beauteous form;
and received the revelation of the Koran; before all three objects: 1. the
five daily prayers; 2. the final verses of the second Sura of the Koran; 3.
forgiveness of all sins, except that of idolatry, for his people. Here the
Almighty pronounced the words: “If it had not been for thee, the world
would never have been created.”&mdash;(See <abbr title="volume One pages">vol. I. pp.</abbr> 2-3). A drop
flowed from the throne into the mouth of the prophet, who by it imbibed
all the knowledge of the anterior and posterior world. All the Angels
joined in a chorus, singing: “There is no God but one God, and Muhammed
is his prophet;” and the great concert terminated with the
words of the Koran, (<abbr title="chapter Two verse">chap. II. v.</abbr> 285): “The Apostle believeth in that
which has been sent down unto him from his Lord, and the faithful
also. Every one of them believeth in God and his Angels, and his
Scriptures, and his Apostles. And they say: ‘We have heard and
do obey; we implore thy mercy, O Lord! for unto thee must we
return.’”</p>

<p class="p2 hanging"><span class="sc">Section <abbr title="Three">III</abbr>.&mdash;Of the Successors of these Philosophers,
and the chief Followers of this Creed.</span></p>

<p>Of this class, several learned men were personally
known to the author of this book, but he will give
an account of those only who were well founded
and skilled in this creed. First, the doctor in theology,
Hírbed, whom the author visited in Lahore.
This doctor was a descendant from the family of
Zardúsht, the prophet of God; he was conversant
with Persian, showed great proficiency in Arabic,
and in other sciences, in Shiraz, and held intercourse
with learned Frangis. At last he came to India;
always devoted to austerity, he led a pure and holy
life. He composed hymns in Persian, Hindi, and
Arabic, to the majesty of the light of lights, the powerful
luminaries, and the stars. He acknowledged
as a Kiblah the splendor-shedding bodies, and made
his own, in spirit and word, the work of the lord
Shaikh Maktul. Secondly, the doctor Manír was
met by the writer of this work, in the year of the
Hejira 1053 (A. D. 1643-4), in Kabul; he was one
<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pageno">205</span>
of the Sáíds of Shiraz, but entered the elemental
world in Irâk Ajem; he was skilful in sciences, and
lived as a chaste independent and pious man; like
Hirbed, he abstained from all sorts of animal food,
and sang the hymns which go under the name of
Shaikh Maktul, in praise of the luminaries, and
venerated the stars; and both these persons paid
homage with the sun, refulgent with light. The third
was <span class="person">Hakím dostúr</span>, who in 1054 of the Hejira (A. D.
1644-5) came to Lahore. He drew his origin from
Ispáhan, but was born in Balkh; he studied in the
service of the followers of Mulla Mírza Khan; then,
having gone to Iran, he held intercourse with Mír
Muhammed Báker dámád, with Shaikh Baháv-ed-din
Muhammed, with Mír Abúl Kásem Kandersaki,
and with other learned men and Ulamá of Shiraz,
not without great profit to himself; he attached
himself to the rule of the <span class="title">Masháyín</span>, “peripatetics,”
and repeated the prayers which were written by the
chief of this persuasion in praise of the self-existent
Being, the intelligences, and spirits, and stars; and
he was very zealously addicted to the worship of the
heavenly bodies; although without pious austerity,
yet he abstained from wickedness, and kept the way
of moderation; according to the custom of merchants,
he travelled a great deal. A fourth was
<span class="person">Kámrán</span>, of Shíraz. He also followed the creed of
the Masháyín; he possessed the natural and revealed
<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pageno">206</span>
sciences; and after having acquired excellence, he
happened to find himself at the mountain which is
near the sea-ports of the Frangis; he took a great
liking to their society, and was attracted by the religion
of the Nasáreans: on that account he studied
the Gospel, and derived great profit from their doctrines.
Afterwards he went to India, where he contracted
friendship with some Rájas; he became fond
of their religion; read, with learned Brahmans, the
sástras of the Hindús, that is, their scientific books,
and in these also he became a master of art among
the learned of India. Although ostensibly he adopted
the said faith, yet he remained attached to the religion
of the ancient philosophers. He showed great
aversion to lying, thieving, debauchery, and unnatural
love; and, according to the custom of the wise,
forbore from killing animals; but now and then he
indulged in a draught of wine, saying that it is very
salutary. He was wont to sing hymns, which are
in use among the Yúnian philosophers, and are now
translated, in praise of God, the high intelligences
and spirits, and the stars. He accepted no gift from
any body; he was employed in trade, but he contented
himself with a competent capital. Mír Abú
’l Kásem Kandarsakí called him “a brother dear as
life,” nay, wrote to him as to an “elder brother.”
In the year of the Hejira 1050 (A. D. 1640-1) he
retired to solitude at the <span class="title">Serai Fargh</span>, “the fortunate
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pageno">207</span>
palace,” near the heaven-built town of <span class="place">Akbarabad</span>.
It is said that, in his malady, he bestowed all
he possessed in gift upon the Durvishes, and the
ready money upon the Brahmans of Vichnu, and
the like, who never hurt a living being. He delivered
garments into the care of one named Muhammed,
that this man might distribute them among
the poor upon the road of Kachmir and Kabul,
where the cold is severe, which Muhammed did; he
there collected forage and provisions, which were
given to cows, asses, to travellers, and the indigent,
because they carry loads; he also confided scientific
books to one called Húshíar, that he might give
them to doctors devoted to science, and Húshíar so
disposed in Agra of the works which he had received,
and sent them to his friends. During his mortal
malady he was constantly engaged in reading the
<cite>Alhíyát shafá</cite>, “the hymns of recovery,” and in translating
the <cite>Asúlújía</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_148" id="fnanchor_148"></a><a href="#footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></span>
“Theologia,” and he sang cheerfully:
“I believe in the divinity of the most high
Creator, the prophecy of intelligence, the Imámet
of the spirit, the heaven as a Kiblah, and the liberation
of philosophy, and I detest the free-thinkers,
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pageno">208</span>
and other religions.” At the moment of death,
he pronounced the names of the self-existent Being,
of the intelligence and spirit, and of the stars, and
the by-standers also joined him in chorus, until he
had left the mortal garment. His life exceeded one
hundred years, and he had preserved his strength
and his faculties entire. He gave these directions to
Húshíar, that after death to be burnt would be preferable,
but, if the people prevented it, Húshíar
should bury him with his feet to the West, as all
distinguished personages, such as Aristotle and his
followers, repose in the same way. Húshíar executed
his will, and also, according to his direction,
burnt at the head of his tomb, during a whole week,
every day and every night, a lamp to the honor of
the star which at that time ruled over him, and distributed
the food and raiment which are appropriated
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pageno">209</span>
to that star among the Brahmans and necessitous,
who all prayed to render the star propitious,
in order that the soul of Hakím Kámrán might be
united with the pure spirits. Húshíar went afterwards
to Agra, and I saw a book in the hand-writing
of Húshíár, in which was stated, that he, after
Kámrán’s death, saw him in a dream clothed in
a fine garment, and sitting by the side of the lord
<span class="title">Mashterí</span>, “Jupiter.” Húshíar asked him: “How
camest thou to this place?” He answered: “The
pure spirits, when they saw me free from worldly
desires, drew me to them, and by the aid of their
intercession, I was made one of the angels.”</p>

<p>The creed of the Hakíms Hírbed and Manír, with
regard to the reality of inspired persons, was, that
these celebrated men were perfect sages, and masters
of an excellent condition; by their words and
deeds they reached the state of perfection, on which
account they treated mysterious questions relative
to theoretical and practical wisdom with the confidence
of pure truth; but for the sake of the vulgar,
they used a typical and allegorical language, leaving
it to other sages, the able chiefs and saints of their
persuasion, to explain the law and the religion: this
is the creed of philosophers.</p>

<p>The prophets of Persia, such as Abád, Zardusht,
and the like, are called <span class="title">Vakhshúr</span>; the apostles of the
<span class="title">Yonán</span> and of Rome are <span class="title">Aghásá daimún</span> (Agatho demon);<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_149" id="fnanchor_149"></a><a href="#footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></span>
<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><span class="pageno">210</span>
<span class="title">Hermes</span>, and the like, whom they name “possessors
of fame;” the prophets of the Hindus,
such as Ráma, Krishna, and the like, are entitled <span class="title">Ava
társ</span>; and the prophets of the Turks, such as <span class="title">Aghríres</span>
and <span class="title">Aghúrkhan</span>, are distinguished by the name of <span class="title">Abulmas</span>.
The prophets of Islám, from Adam, the father
of mankind, to Muhammed, are called <span class="title">resul</span>. In
like manner the prophets of other nations were
distinguished by titles such as <span class="title">buzerg</span>, “great,” or
<span class="title">sádik</span>, “pure.” They said: it is right that no other
prophet should come after the one: which is signified
by the <em>seal of the prophetic mission</em>, that is, “the
utmost dignity of mankind.” <span class="person">Ibn Makanâ Sáheb-i-Mah
Kashgher</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_150" id="fnanchor_150"></a><a href="#footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></span>
also was reckoned among the
prophets, and such was the controversy which arose
about the head-khaláfet, the distinction, precedence,
and rejection of the lords among each other,
that it has not yet been brought to a satisfactory
conclusion. They said that there were four celebrated
doctors; if a controversy arose, this is nothing
less than what is proper to mankind, as no
man can be free from the attributes of his race; on
that account they abstained from reviling the case
of Môávíah, but they said that he was a great personage.
But the creed of the Hakím Dostur was,
that the prophets of the Persians, Hindus, Yonans,
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">211</span>
Turks, and Arabs, and such people, were promoting
the establishment of a sort of knowledge and of
some sorts of sciences; the philosophers, exerting
themselves by the aid of the reasoning faculty, become
founders of theoretical schools, and also lend
their assistance with respect to theology. The scope
of an <span class="title">Hakím</span> is, that his reason may direct its laborious
efforts towards all quarters, and, inasmuch as
may be in its power, to bear a resemblance to the
Lord God, the self-existent Being. The utmost
endeavor of the prophets is, that the order of the
world may be evident to them, so that they may,
according to this order, arrange the affairs of society.
But this order of affairs cannot be exempt
from the excitement of desire, terror, and dubiousness;
although, certainly, whatever the masters
of law and religion have combined into a system,
may be explained by what certain eminent
philosophers have exhibited. Among other things
it is said, that the world is very ancient, and its
eternity without beginning and end indubitable.
In the sequel, a learned Hakím raises pretensions to
inspiration, excites others to the adoption of a creed
which he endeavors to render firm. But Hakím
Kámzán assented to no inspiration, he said:&mdash;In
ancient times, sages established customs and regulations
for the order of the world, and, as long as the
inhabitants conformed to them, there was not the
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
least oppression in their doings; until finally they
collected into a nation, worshipping pleasure and
bent upon worldliness; then arose concealment of
truth from the people, union by the strength of
parentage, combination by fraud, and enveigling by
means of enchantment and the like, by which idiots
were drawn into a net. When those who implored
protection were seized by the oppressors, helpless,
the prudent among them bent down their heads;
because when the strong become masters of the day,
men submit to them on account of their being superior
to the weak people, who have timid souls; thus
they accepted their dominion by force, and contention
ensued in the world. Moises was held to be
an enchanter, and called <span class="title">rabí Moises</span>; rabí being the
name given by the Jews to the learned; Jesus was
accounted a physician, and entitled <span class="title">Hakím Jesus</span>,
son of Joseph, the carpenter; Muhammed bore the
name of “the prophet of God, the king of the Arabian
poets;”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_151" id="fnanchor_151"></a><a href="#footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></span>
Krishna went under the name of
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">213</span>
<span class="title">Avátar chahnál</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_152" id="fnanchor_152"></a><a href="#footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></span>
that is, the “incarnation of the lewd,
and devoted to women.” And thus the celebrated
prophets were distinguished. The intelligent know
well that the most high Creator does not articulate
words, but the sacred dictates which the vulgar receive
are to be thus considered&mdash;that, if those books
which they call “heavenly,” such as the Koran,
were really the words of God, which were delivered
in time past to our ancestors, such as to Adam and
Noah, it would be right that they should be also communicated
in time to come to future generations,
expressing, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: that in such a time and year, and
month and week, on such a day, at such an hour, a
person shall appear, in such a town and such a
street, tribe sprung from such a one, with such a
name, and such an aspect. But such an account is
not to be found in the Koran; it is only by the interpretation
of his followers that many traditions about
Muhammed are current. The same may be said of
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">214</span>
other prophets. For if it were stated in the book of
Jesus, that at the determined time, as we have just
shown, there shall appear a person whose name in
Arabia shall be Muhammed, sprung from the father
Abd ’ulla and the mother Amíná, from the children
Hashem and Korésh, inhabitants of Mecca; and he
shall be the last prophet of the age; all the Christians
should acknowledge and believe in him. And
in the same manner there should have been, in the
book of Moses, a prediction of Jesus, and a further
account of events which took place at his appearance.
But this is not the case, except that the followers of
Jesus seize, in figurative language, on whatever may
suit their persuasion. Thus it happened that one
of the Afgháns applied the words: “Say, there is
but one God,” to himself.</p>

<p>He further said: “If I agree to their prophetic
mission, whence was it shown that this people were
prophets? for, if pursuant to their claim to prophetic
office and legislation, we adopt what at every
time is held out as legal, why are their fundamental
articles of faith in contradiction to each other with
respect to the knowledge of the self-existent Being?
Thus, in the Pentateuch of the Jews, God has a
body, and corporeity; and the Christians believe
Jesus a son of God, and the Muhammedans according
to the Koran believe God to be without an equal,
and not to be described. If God be similar to what
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
he is represented in all these books, he is not unlike
a man who does not know himself, and at each time
gives an account of himself, which he varies, and of
which he repents. If they say, the real sense is the
same, the figurative expression and interpretation
only change, it is not less evident, that the books
and the prophets have been sent for the purpose of
leading men to God, and not to instigate them to
rebel; or, after having proclaimed his word, to combat
each other by controversy. He commands the
sacrifice of their blood and property for the common
good. And if they say, the servants cannot disagree
about the knowledge of God, why then is it written
in the books that they must know him in that, and
in no other way? and why do we perceive such a
contradiction in the deeds, and frequently in the
words, of the celebrated prophets? The intelligent
man can no longer recognise them by their noble
actions.</p>

<p>Somebody said to the Hakím Kámrán: “Give me
in substance the belief of the Sonnites and the
Shíâhs.” He replied: “The creed of the Sonnites
is, after the praise of God the most high, and
the attributes of the prophet, blessing and mercy
of God upon all transgressors and sinners, men,
and women; and the creed of the Shíâhs is after
the praise of God, and the attributes of the prophet,
the curse of God upon all believers, men
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">216</span>
and women; and Muselmans, men and women.”
And he had much to say about this subject.</p>

<p><span class="person">Abu ’l Hassan Taheraní</span>, surnamed <span class="title">Isfahán</span>, son of
<span class="person">Gháib báig</span>, surnamed <span class="title">Iâtimad eddoulah</span>, became a
follower of Kámrán, by the persuasion of the friends
of the latter, as the author of this book perceived in
a letter, written by <span class="person">Rafiâ ’l Kader</span> to Hakím Kámrán,
in which the former declared himself the disciple of
Kámrán, whom he called his master, and addressed
in a suitable style. Thus was also Zemán Baig born,
in Arghún, his father, a native of Kabul, was surnamed
Mahábet Khán, who, by his gravity, bravery,
and wisdom, acquired a high rank among the Omras
of the Indian Sultans. He was in a friendly connection
with Kámrán, and in the letters which the
mighty khan wrote to Hakím Kámrán, he showed
him great respect, and professed himself his disciple.
It is said that, at a banquet, Mahábet Khan
declared the saying of the prophetic asylum<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“I was a prophet, and Adam in water and mud&mdash;”</p>

<p class="unindent">to be without sense. Further, whoever acknowledges
the prophetic mission of Muhammed accounts
it to begin after the prophet’s fortieth year, and whoever
does not acknowledge it, is free in this opinion.
Muhammed said: “<cite>I was a prophet, and Adam in water
and mud.</cite>” Kámrán went seldom into the houses
of this sect, and kept himself at a distance from
them. When, yielding to a thousand entreaties, he
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">217</span>
visited them, he changed his usual dress, sat only
a moment with them, and rose immediately; he
never ate with them, nor accepted he any thing
from one of this sect. When asked upon his keeping
himself at a distance from them, he said: “The
spirit of brutishness and savagery holds its mastership
over you, and I cannot always associate
with brutes and beasts of prey.” He remained
even a long time without seeing them. But <span class="person">Abd ul
rasul</span> frequented him, and, conformably to Kámrán’s
advice, detached himself from worldly desires, and
crushed anger and lust in his mind. On that account
Hakím Kámrán, having conceived friendship for him,
taught him first the rules of grammar and etymology,
then the <span class="title">Sherah Shamsíyah</span>, “Commentary upon
Shamsiyah;”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_153" id="fnanchor_153"></a><a href="#footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></span>
besides the physiological part of the
Commentary upon <span class="title">Hedáyah al hikmet</span>, “the Guide to
Science,” composed by <span class="person">Hossain</span>, son of <span class="person">Mâyin eddin
Maibedí</span>;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_154" id="fnanchor_154"></a><a href="#footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></span>
further, matters relating to the Commentary
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">218</span>
upon <span class="title">Hikmet al âin</span>, “the Science of what is
“essential,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_155" id="fnanchor_155"></a><a href="#footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></span>
and afterwards the Commentary upon
<span class="title">Tajeríd</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_156" id="fnanchor_156"></a><a href="#footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></span>
“Divestment of what is accessory,” with

“Indications (allegorical,
symbolical, and others);” and, finally, the
<span class="title">Ilahyat shafa</span>, “the Hymns of Recovery.” Thus
also, Mulla Yacúb read with him the <span class="title">Taherir</span>,
“Writings” of Euclid, and a Commentary upon
<span class="title">Tazkerah</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_158" id="fnanchor_158"></a><a href="#footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></span>
“Commemoration;” and was attached
to him. Likewise Mír Sheríf, having read the <i>Mutavel</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_159" id="fnanchor_159"></a><a href="#footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></span>

“Development,” and the <i>Tafsir</i>, “Explanation,”
of Baízavi,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_160" id="fnanchor_160"></a><a href="#footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></span>
resolved to follow his school;
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">219</span>
and, what is more astonishing, Mulla Usám read with
him the illustrations and demonstrations which are
in the fundamentals of Hanifa’s religious law, and
adopted his faith. But Mulla Sultan, although he
acknowledged his high rank of excellence, never
adhered to him. And Hakím Kámrán said: “What
is not understood, becomes a subject of dispute.”
Thus Mulla Sultán followed with intense application
the study of the soul, and the chain of demonstrations
relative to it, but he said: “I am not able
to understand its nature, and am, in that respect,
like a parrot.” Among the able disciples of Hakím
Kámrán was Hakím Mershed, who passed
through all degrees of science before him, and possessed
his entire confidence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_161" id="fnanchor_161"></a><a href="#footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></span>
Hakím Kámrán was
wont at that time, when he gave lessons of science,
to wash his head, hands, and feet, to burn sweet
perfumes, and to turn his face towards the sun, in
which his disciples imitated him. He did not confer
his instruction upon every body, but refused it to
the depraved, the oppressors, and the voluptuous;
nor did he hold intercourse with low persons.</p>

 <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">اسو لوجي</span> is supposed to be one of Aristotle’s works, which is said
to have been translated by <span class="person">Abenama</span>, a Saracen, from Greek into Arabic.
This translation was found in the library of Damascus, by <span class="person">Franciscus
Roseus</span>, and at his request rendered into Latin, by <span class="person">Moses Koras</span>, a Jew,
but in a very barbarous style. This interpretation has perhaps never
been published. Soon after, or about the same time, <span class="person">Petrus Nicolaus ex

same work from Arabic into Latin; this new version was published with
a dedication to Leo <abbr title="Ten">X.</abbr>, in 1718, by the above-said Franciscus Roseus.
As it did not appear a sufficiently neat composition, <span class="person">Jacobus Carpentarius
Claromontanus Bellovacus</span>, a Parisian philosopher, who was ignorant of
Arabic, published, in 1571, an emendated edition, or rather a meta-phrase
of this work, under the title: <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aristotelis libri <abbr title="14">XIV</abbr> de secretiore

latter the more exact although less elegant version of Petrus Nicolaus,

the universal Being is distinct from any intellectual
and exterior existence, inasmuch as every individual
from among the intellectual and exterior beings
belongs to some class of beings; but the universal
Being is not subordinate to the condition of any
thing; he is absolute and sovereign, and not general,
not partial, not special, not common, and not one

nor an accident, but by itself one, and not a

<p>Some of the sagacious have stated that, in the
same manner as the sun is radiant, so the real Being
manifests himself at once for in opposition to it is
<dfn>âdem</dfn>, “non-entity,” and from the superabundance
of manifestation the tongue and language (in the
effort) to express and to describe, to define and to
explain, become dumb. The final explanation of
the two words, <dfn>vojud</dfn>, “existence,” and <dfn>âdem</dfn>, “non-entity”
may be, that existence is the negation of
non-entity, and non-entity the negation of existence;
and the Lord of unity is the grand origin of the multiplicity
of names and attributes. The first attribute,
which emerged into manifestation by this Lord
from within, was intelligence; and in this degree all
<dfn>aâyán sabitah</dfn>, “fixed realities,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_174" id="fnanchor_174"></a><a href="#footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></span>
were under intellectual
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pageno">224</span>
forms, and in this degree the Súfís give to the
true highest and absolute Being the name of “All-Wise.”
The impulsion of divine wisdom to procure
to his fixed ideals the superiority over non-entity
is by them entitled <dfn>irádet</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_175" id="fnanchor_175"></a><a href="#footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></span>
“providence,” and
the name of <dfn>murid</dfn>, “he who wills,” attached to
God. As often as the divine knowledge becomes
joined to accomplishment and victory, as having
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pageno">225</span>
given to the existence of knowledge the superiority
over contingencies, in this degree they call this victory
<dfn>kadaret</dfn>, “might;” and in this degree originated
the name of <dfn>Kadir</dfn>, “Almighty.” With respect
to the seeing of God, as the meaning of knowledge
is his presence in face of the existing external
figures of contingencies, in this degree, the name
of <dfn>Básír</dfn>, “the All-Seeing,” offered itself. Likewise,
the meditation upon God, by those who, praying,
recite his emblematic attributes, is the time of
propitiating; and the granting of these prayers is
called <dfn>samíâ</dfn>, “hearing:” whence proceeded the
name samíâ, “hearer.” Further, the will of God,
the Highest, becoming concentrated in this state,
having joined the letter <span class="decoration">kaf</span> (k) to the letter <span class="decoration">nún</span> (n),
so as to manifest by action <dfn>kun faíkun</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_176" id="fnanchor_176"></a><a href="#footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></span>
“Be, and it
is:” this state they called <dfn>kalám</dfn>, “the word,”
and the name of <dfn>mutkalem</dfn>, “speaker,” was produced
on this account.</p>

<p>The lord Shaikh Muhammed Shosterí,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_177" id="fnanchor_177"></a><a href="#footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></span>
in his
treatise <cite>Hak al yakín</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_178" id="fnanchor_178"></a><a href="#footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></span>
“the truth of conviction,” has
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">226</span>
stated, that the action of choice prevails with the
self-existent Being over necessity, because choice is
presupposed in the nature of might, and provident
choice, as well as vicissitudes and excitement, are
parts suitable to a purpose, and providence came to
succour every one of the necessitous crowd, by procreating
remedies against the evils without number
which are determined by necessity, in opposition to
that necessity whence pure procreation proceeds.
When the free agent is straightened in his choice,
then choice assumes the nature of necessity. Thus <span class="person">Ibn
Mâyín eddin Maibedí</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_179" id="fnanchor_179"></a><a href="#footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></span> relates, in his <cite>Favátah</cite>, “Prolegomena,”
that the Súfis say: The wished for, but never-found
Being proceeds from the field of pure non-entity,
and the bare negation puts no foot into the
station of evidence and habitation of bodily existence,
in the same manner as the wished-for but never-found
Being never assumes the color of bodily existence;
certainly, the real Being also does not take the color
of non-entity. The substance of any thing cannot
be caused to vanish into non-existence; thus, if thou
consumest a stick in the fire, its substance is not
annihilated although its form changes, and becomes
manifest in the form of ashes. The self-existent
Being is an essence which is stable in all conditions,
and in the accidents of existence, in the forms and
<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pageno">227</span>
states which undergo changes, the divine procreation
of the world is the manifested light of his absolute
reality, under the shape of divers combinations
which thou beholdest.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Certainly God made the heaven and earth to shine.”</p>

<p>In the book of the sagacious is found that the
beautiful of this world enjoys the advantage of his
beauty, when he beholds and considers its reflexion
in a looking-glass; on that account, the absolute
Being, having been revealed in the mirror of existences
and appropriate places, and having seen his
beauty in various mirrors, and in every one of them
being exhibited under a shape worthy of himself,
become manifest in a series of multitudinous appearances.</p>

<p>The Súfis further say: God is pure, conformable
to his essence, above all purity and comparison, and
in the gradations of names and attributes praised
in both ways. Whoever dispenses with the comparison
of something which has no equal, does not
know that, declaring God to be without an equal, is
comparing him with pure beings. The friends of
God say that his name is of three kinds, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: he is
<dfn>itlák</dfn>, “absolute,” by his essence, or considered as an

and they give him
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pageno">228</span>
the name of <dfn>zát</dfn>, “essence,” like that of <dfn>kadus</dfn>,
“pure, holy;” that is, considered as a substance,
he is the Being the meaning of which is not dependent
upon the meaning of another; they call him
<dfn>sifet</dfn>, “excelling in attributes,” and <dfn>háí</dfn>, “living;”
that is, considered as a substance, he is a Being
whose meaning is dependent upon that of another.
They name him <dfn>fâl</dfn>, “action,” like <dfn>khálik</dfn>, “Creator,”
which is the general name of God, as well as
<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pageno">229</span>
<dfn>rahmen</dfn>, “mercy;” but the great name is at last
<dfn>khafá</dfn>, “the concealed (mysterious).” A person
asked the lord Shaikh <span class="person">Bayezíd Bastámí</span>:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_181" id="fnanchor_181"></a><a href="#footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></span>
“Which is
the great name of God?” The Shaikh answered:
“Communicate thou to me his least name, that I
may give thee in return his greatest:” that is to
say, the names of God are all great.</p>

<p>The sagacious say: Every era is the epoch of the
fame and dominion of a name, and when this epoch
expires, it becomes concealed under the name which
it had at the epoch of its flourishing state.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_182" id="fnanchor_182"></a><a href="#footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pageno">230</span>
They say, the names of the Deity contain the distinct
forms in the divine science, and these are called
<dfn>aâyan sábitah</dfn>, “fixed substances,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_183" id="fnanchor_183"></a><a href="#footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></span>
whether general
or partial, and these intellectual forms received existence
in eternity without beginning,<span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></span>
by <dfn>fayz</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_184" id="fnanchor_184"></a><a href="#footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></span>
“emanation,”
from the essence of God endowed with
most holy emanation. Further, the intellectual forms
rise into evidence with all dependencies and necessary
consequences of the most holy emanation.
The fixed substances have a relation to the names
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pageno">231</span>
of bodies, and to the external substances<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_185" id="fnanchor_185"></a><a href="#footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></span>
of spirits,
and between all beings there arises an interposition
dependent on the degree of excellence
which it has with respect to God. All the reality
of accidental beings lies in the external existence;
the reality of individuals is dependent upon fixed
times, and every one emerges into existence at his
time.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_186" id="fnanchor_186"></a><a href="#footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>The Súfis maintain that all attributes of perfection
are necessarily inherent in the supreme holy essence;
that is, are fixed by the purity of his essence. What
in the accidental substance is fixed by properties,
for instance, thy substance, is not sufficient for
the revelation of thyself; as long as the attribute of
God’s essence, which is the principle of that revelation,
has not taken firm hold of thee, this revelation
<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pageno">232</span>
cannot be obtained. On the contrary, God, the
most High, stands not in need of that revelation of
things, on account of the purity which is inherent
in him; but his essence is the principle of that revelation;
that is, his essence and attributes are one.
On this account, the Amir of the believers, Alí,
said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The perfection of the belief in the unity of God consists in the
negation of attributes.”</p>

<p>The lord Shaikh Dáud Kaiśerí says in the <cite>Sherah-fes
us</cite>, “Commentary upon the bezels:”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_187" id="fnanchor_187"></a><a href="#footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></span>
the knowledge
of God the most High, in his essence, is the
identity of the essence, and the knowledge of this
world is that of the forms of things in it, whether
generally or partially; and if one essence is <em>said to
be</em> the receptacle of manifold things, this <em>acceptation</em>
is not to be feared, as the things are identic with God
according to the acceptation of “existence,” and in
truth are different <em>only</em> according to the acceptation
of being either involved or manifested. Further, in
reality, there is neither state nor place, but there is
one object exhibited under forms of decoration and
portraiture by external appearances. <dfn>Kasá</dfn>, “God’s
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pageno">233</span>
universal judgment or decree (predestination)” is
the summary decision of the conditions of existence,
as the decision for the death of all mankind; and
<dfn>Kadr</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_188" id="fnanchor_188"></a><a href="#footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></span> is “the interpretation of that decision by
determined means, and in consequence of results
conformable to the faculties;” for instance, the
decision of the death of Záid, on such a day, by
such a malady. <dfn>Kas a</dfn>, “predestination,” is the
eternal knowledge concerning existences, and this
knowledge is dependent on the <dfn>âyán sábitah</dfn>, “fixed
substances.” Each thing demands, by disposition,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_189" id="fnanchor_189"></a><a href="#footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></span>
a peculiar emanation of God.</p>

<p>The Súfis say, according to the sacred text:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“God created man according to his image.”</p>

<p>We have the power of acting on account of our
being the mirror of the supreme essence; if we say:
“The action is ours,” it may be right; and if we say:
“It is of God,” it is equally true. The master of
the rose-bower says:</p>

<p>The Súfis say that the whole heaven is a body, the
first intelligence its soul, the breath of the whole his
heart, and the spirits of the seven planets, of the
fixed stars and the rest, are his power.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Your creation and your resurrection are as those of one man.”</p>

<p>The Shaikh Mohí eddin<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_191" id="fnanchor_191"></a><a href="#footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></span>
says in his <cite>Faś hawdí</cite>,
<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class="pageno">235</span>
“chapter of repentance:” The world is the image of
God, and he the soul and governor of the universe,
further he is the great mankind. The lord Maulavi
Jámí, in the <cite>Nakd-al faśus</cite>, “the ready money of
bezels,” states, that there are two divisions of the
beings of the universe: the first consists of those who
on no account have any sort of connection with the
bodily world, in conformity to office and direction;
these, called <dfn>Cherubim</dfn>, are divided into two classes:
the one take not the least notice of the world and
its inhabitants, and are named “the great Angels;”
the other, although not connected with the bodily
world, are yet entranced in astonishment as witnesses
and valuers <em>of God’s power</em>, standing at the
curtain of the divine court, and being the ministers
of the supreme bounty; before them is an angel entitled
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">236</span>
“the great spirit,” greater than whom no angel
exists. According to another interpretation he is
said to be “the highest secretary and first intelligence.”
This great spirit (the blessing of God
be upon him!) holds the first rank of this class.
The spirit, who is called <span class="title">Jabríil</span>, follows after him in
this legion.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The rank which he possesses is a place known.”</p>

<p>Another division is composed of those who have
connection with the bodily world according to order
and office; these are named “spirits,” also divided
into two classes: the one are spirits who perform
their office in the heavens, and these are entitled
“the high angels;” the other class are those who
perform their office upon earth, and these bear the
name of “lower angels.” Many thousands of them
are appointed to the human race, and many thousands
to minerals, to plants, and the animal kingdom.
The people of the revelation (prophets) say:
“There, where seven angels are not assembled, not
a leaf can germinate from a branch;” the seven
angels are meant to be seven divine powers. Thus,
the spirits of fire, who are called <dfn>Jin</dfn> and <dfn>Siátín</dfn>,
“genii and demons,” belong to the kind of lower
angels, and <dfn>Iblis</dfn> is their chief and ruler. The lord
Shaikh Mahmúd Shósterí says, that Iblis is the power
of imagination, which the learned call “the material.”
The Súfis give it the name of “the foundation
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pageno">237</span>
of material substance,” or <dfn>Enka</dfn>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_192" id="fnanchor_192"></a><a href="#footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></span>
According
to the Súfis, <em>matter</em> is <dfn>mâdum</dfn>, “not eternally existent.”
They call the absolute body “the universal body.”
The Súfis say, as is found in the
<cite>Favátah</cite>, that the spirit of mankind is the absolute
spirit of the divinity; thus the spirit of mankind, for
the sake of elocution&mdash;that is, excellence&mdash;expresses
itself by sound; and sound, for the sake of elocution,
by various distinct modulations, which in utterance
are made sensible, becomes a word, and by the
combination of words a language acquires reality.
The Shaikh Muhammed <span class="person">Láhaji</span><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_193" id="fnanchor_193"></a><a href="#footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></span> says, in his Commentary
on <cite>Gulshen raz</cite>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_194" id="fnanchor_194"></a><a href="#footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></span>
“the Mystery of the Rosebower,”
that the meaning of the expression “the
divine spirit,” is “the revelation of truth in the
circus of multiplicity,” and in the <cite>Sharh mahtaśer</cite>,
“abridged Commentary (epitome)” on <cite>Gulshen</cite>, is
found that, in like manner as the spirit of mankind
becomes sound, and sound a word, so also the divine
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><span class="pageno">238</span>
spirit becomes <dfn>jawher</dfn>, “substance,” and substances
become spirits and forms; thus human nature is
determined in a manner that its hidden conditions
proceed from the interior to manifestation.</p>

<p>The presence of the universal deity, which is
expansive in the divine spirit and soul), is fivefold.
The first is <dfn>hazeret ghaib mut´lak</dfn>, “the presence of
the absolute mystery,” and this is one with the
<dfn>aâyían sábatah</dfn>, “the invariable prototypes (realities
of things).” The second is the <dfn>hazeret ghaib muśáf</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_195" id="fnanchor_195"></a><a href="#footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></span>
“the presence of the relative mystery,” which
is nearest the absolute mystery, and this belongs to
pure intellects and spirits. The third is the <dfn>hazeret
musáf ghaib</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_196" id="fnanchor_196"></a><a href="#footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></span>
“the presence of the mysterious relation,”
which is nearest the absolute evidence; this
is the world of similitude, or dream. The fourth is
the <dfn>hazeret shahádet mut´lak</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_197" id="fnanchor_197"></a><a href="#footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></span>
“the presence of the
absolute evidence,” which reaches from the centre
of the earth to the middle of the ninth empyrean
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">239</span>
heaven. The fifth is the <dfn>hazerát jámâh</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_198" id="fnanchor_198"></a><a href="#footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></span>
“the presence
of the vest,” and this is the universe in an
extensive, and mankind in a restricted, acceptation.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_199" id="fnanchor_199"></a><a href="#footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The Súfis besides say: The world is life and intellect,
as far as the mineral kingdom; but the manifestation
of intellect in every body is determined by
the temperature of the human constitution. Sometimes
bounty attains an excellence which is uttered
with ecstacy, and becomes a modulation more powerful
than that which strikes the ear: and this is the
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">240</span>
mode of the prophet (blessing upon him!). Thus
is it commonly related that Jabrííl brought to the
blessed prophet the happy news, that his poor followers
will enter heaven five hundred years sooner
than the rich. The prophet, full of joy, said: “Can
none of you recite a verse?” A person proffered
these distichs:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i2b">“The serpent of desire bit my heart:</div>
  <div class="i2">There is, to cure me, neither doctor nor magician,</div>
  <div class="i2">If not the friend whom I adore:</div>
  <div class="i0">He alone possesses the theriac and the amulet suitable to my cure.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Upon this the lord prophet, with his companions,
moved about in ecstacy, with such a violence that
the cloak fell from his shoulder.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_200" id="fnanchor_200"></a><a href="#footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Further, the sagacious say that the forms of the
sensible world are shades of seeming forms. The
Súfis also maintain that a spirit cannot exist without
a body;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_201" id="fnanchor_201"></a><a href="#footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></span>
when it breaks forth from a body, it obtains,
according to its deeds and actions, an apparent
body, which they call <dfn>acquired</dfn>.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_162"><span class="muchsmaller">[162]</span></a>
 Several derivations are given to the word <span class="title">Sufí</span>; it may be here sufficient
to adduce the three most specious of them. Some derive the
name from the verb <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">صفا</span>, <dfn>Safá</dfn>, “he was sincere, pure;” this derivation
is claimed by these sectaries themselves, who frequently call themselves
<span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">اصفيا</span>, <dfn>Asfíá</dfn>, “pure,” as may be seen in Jami’s work, <cite>Tohfat
ol ebrar</cite>, “a present offered to the pious:” and in <cite>Gulshenraz</cite> (work
quoted). To this etymology is objected, that a substantive derived from
the said verb should be <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">صفى,</span>, and not <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">صوفى</span>. Others deduce it with
grammatical strictness from <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">صوف</span> <dfn>súf</dfn>, “wool,” and <dfn>sufí</dfn> signifies
therefore “wool-dressed.” But the fact is, that not all wool-dressed persons
are Súfis, and not all Súfis are wool-dressed: a Súfi may wear a Durvish’s
patched coat, or satin, as it was said by a true Súfi. If, of the two
etymologies quoted, the first does not answer the grammatical construction,
the second does not render the meaning to be expressed. The latter
appears to me so much more important, that I am disposed to pass over
an anomalous construction, which in other names is not without numerous
examples. Nor would I be averse to derive the word, with other
etymologists, from the Greek σοφος, “wise,” or σαφες, “pure;” notwithstanding
the general use of representing in words of Greek derivation
the <em>sigma</em>, Σ, by a <em>sin</em>, <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">س</span>, and not by a <dfn>sad</dfn>, <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">ص</span>, if I did not
perceive a great difference between the doctrine of a <span class="title">Sofos</span> and that of a
<span class="title">Súfi</span>, which latter bears most especially an Asiatic character, and the
origin of which remounts to the kings Mahabad and Jemshid (<cite>Dasá tir</cite>,
<abbr title="English Translation, pages">Eng. Transl., pp.</abbr> 23, 97). Our author says: “Súfism is to be found
among all nations.” The first Muhammedan Súfi is said to have been
<span class="person">Abu Hashem</span>, a native of Kufa, who died in the year of the Hejira 150
(A. D. 767).&mdash;(See <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Notices et Extraits des manuscrits de la bibliothèque
du Roi et d’autres bibliothèques</cite>, <abbr title="volume Ten page">vol. X. p.</abbr> 290.) The origin of such a
character among Muselmans, if not in name, yet in fact, may be traced
further back to the first century of the Hejira.&mdash;(See <a href="#footnote_15">note 2</a>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 18.)</p>

 The above <dfn>shí</dfn> and <dfn>láshí</dfn> is evidently the <dfn>sad asat</dfn>, “being, not

unity. “For,” says the author of Gulshen Raz (see German <abbr title="Translation">Transl.</abbr>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 17), “unity exists in non-existence as well as in existence; multiplicity
proceeds but from relation; difference and variety of things proceed
from the change of the possible: as the existence of both is but
one, they furnish the proof that God is but one.”</p>

 <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">اعيان الثابته</span>. <dfn>Aâyan</dfn> signifies “substances:” these are things
which maintain themselves by themselves; or realities, which occupy a
space by themselves, without their existence in space depending upon the
concomitant existence of another thing. This is the contrary of accidents,
the existence of which depends upon the concomitant existence of
the substance which serves to support them, or which is the place by
which they are supported. <dfn>Aâyán sabitah</dfn>, that is, “fixed substances,”
are realities of things inclosed in the science of God, that is to say, the
figures of realities of divine names in the <em>scientific presence</em>. They are
posterior to God only as to essence, and not as to time; for they are eternal,
as much on the side of the past as on the side of the future. When it
is said, that God produces them by emanation, the posteriority which is
thereby expressed, refers but to essence, and is not true in any other
sense.&mdash;(See <cite>Jorjani’s Definitions in <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Extraits et Notices">Ext. et Not.</abbr> des MSS.</cite>, <abbr title="volume Ten page">vol. X. p.</abbr>

by “eternal ideals,” or “prototypes of realities.” Silvestre de Sacy adds
to Jorjani’s explanation, that the question is here about divine names,
that is, attributes of God as emanating from his essence, and residing in
him, but not yet produced externally by any action. <em>The scientific presence</em>
mentioned in this explanation appears, to him, to signify the divine
majesty, inasmuch as manifesting its presence to beings which have no
other existence but in the science of God.</p>

he acts in one manner rather than in another. In its exact sense, it is a
faculty which has no other object in view but that which does not exist;
for “the will” is an attribute, the special object of which is to give existence
to any thing, and to produce it conformably with the words of the
Koran: “<cite>When he wills a thing he says to it: “Be,” and it is.</cite>” <dfn>Iradet</dfn>

 Bastam is a town of Khorassan, the native place of <span class="person">Abu Yezid Taifer
ben Issa</span>, one of the most celebrated Súfis of Persia. He had inherited
the frock of another mystical personage, called Habib Ajemi. Bastami
attained the supreme degree of spirituality&mdash;perfect union with God. He
occasionally branched out into all the enthusiasm imaginable, saying
that God was with him and near him, nay in the sleeve of his garment;
and then again he came at times into the regular order of piety and
devotion, hoping that God would forgive him his sins, and let his latter
end be that of the righteous. It is said of him (see the third <dfn>Majalis</dfn>,
“conference,” of Sâdi) that, having once called out to God for union
with the supreme Being, he heard the voice from above: “Abu Yezid, thy
<em>thou</em> is still with thee; if thou wilt come to me, abandon thyself and
come.” He died in the year of the Hejira 261 (A. D. 874).&mdash;(See

is the turn of the manifestation of a name (divine); when the turn of

which the turn of denomination is arrived. The periods of the seven
planets, each of one thousand years, are attached to it; and the words

 The name of <span class="title">Jabr</span> is common to several doctors of Muselmanism.
The most ancient of them is <span class="person">Abu Abd-allah Jabr Ben Abd allah al
Ansari</span>, a native of Medina, as it is indicated by his surname. Jabr,
according to Mirkhond, first a pagan, after having examined the sacred
books of all other nations, Jews and Christians, was vanquished by Muhammed’s
eloquence, and adopted his faith.</p>

<p class="footnote">Another Jabr is <span class="person">Abu Mussa Jabr Ben Haíían al Sufi</span>, author of the
book <cite>Kitab al Jafr</cite>, and of many other, some say five hundred, works
upon the philosopher’s stone. He lived in the middle of the third century
of the Hejira (about A. D. 864).</p>

 <span class="title">Mohi-eddin</span>, “he who makes religion revive and flourish,” is a surname
borne by several Muselman doctors. The above-mentioned is <span class="person">Mohi-eddin
Ibn al Arabi</span>, born in Kordua, in Spain, of an Arabian family,
called <span class="title">Tayí</span>, in the year of the Hejira 560 (A. D. 1164). He studied in
the academy of Seville, and then visited Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt,
where he heard the most distinguished Shaikhs of his time. He became
the founder of a mystic school from which, among other remarkable
disciples, the great <span class="person">Maulana Jelal-eddin Rumí</span> issued; he is called “the
Pole of the mystic world.” He died in the year of the Hejira 638
(A. D. 1240), in his seventy-sixth year, and was buried at the foot of
mount Cassius, near Damascus, where his sepulchral monument is still
well preserved. He left thirty-three works, which are enumerated by
Baron von Hammer, the illustrious historian of the Ottoman empire.&mdash;(See

Sambhal, in Rohilkunt, according to others, at Amroha, in the province
of Delhi, where his tomb still exists. There the devotees assemble every

 This is a very abstruse doctrine. To throw more light upon it,
I shall subjoin the explanation given by Jorjáni upon this subject, according
to the French translation of Silvestre de Sacy (see <cite><abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Notices et Extraits">Not. et Ext.</abbr> des
MSS.</cite>, <abbr title="volume Ten page">vol. X. p.</abbr> 66): “The five divine presences are: 1. <em>the presence of
the absolute absence</em> (or mystery); its world is the world of <em>the fixed substances
in the scientific presence</em> (see <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 223, 224, <a href="#footnote_174">note 2</a>). To the presence
of the absolute mystery is opposed:&mdash;2. <em>the presence of the absolute
assistance</em>; its world is that named <dfn>Aalem al mulk</dfn> (that is, the world of
the throne or seat of God, of the four elemental natures); 3. <em>the presence
of the relative absence</em>; this is divided into two parts: the one, 3. <em>nearer
the presence of the absolute mystery</em>; the world of which is that of spirits,
which belong to what is called <dfn>jabrut</dfn> and <dfn>malkut</dfn>, that is, of intelligences
and of bare souls; the other: 4. <em>nearer the presence of the absolute
assistance</em>; and the world of which is that of models (images),
called <dfn>Aalem al mulkut</dfn>; 5. the presence which comprises the four preceding
ones; and its world is the world of mankind, a world which reunites
all the worlds, and all they contain.” This statement differs somewhat
from that of our text; to exhibit and to develop, in all their variations,
the systems of Súfism is far beyond the compass of these notes, and
would require a separate work.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_200" id="footnote_200"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_200"><span class="muchsmaller">[200]</span></a>
 Such a tradition existing, we cannot wonder that, from early time
to our days, among the religious practices of Durvishes, Súfis, and monastic
congregations, there are different kinds of dances, accompanied by
song, with or without instrumental music.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_201"><span class="muchsmaller">[201]</span></a>
 The celebrated Leibnitz entertained a similar opinion in consequence
of his great principle of “<cite>the sufficient reason</cite>,” he was persuaded
that all souls, after death, remain united to an organic whole: “Because,”
says he, in his <cite>Théodicée</cite> (<abbr title="Section">§</abbr> 90), “there is no appearance, that
there be, in the order of nature, souls entirely separate from any sort
of body.”&mdash;(See on this subject <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Palingénésie philosophique, par

<span class="sc">Section II.&mdash;Of the prophetic Office; and Explanation
of the public Declarations conformable to
the Revelation of inspired Persons.</span></p>

<p>The Súfis say: The prophet is a person who is sent
to the people as their guide to the perfection which
is fixed for them in the scientific presence (of God)
according to the exigency of the dispositions determined
by the fixed substances, whether it be the
perfection of faith, or another. The Shaikh Hamíd
eddin Nagóri<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_202" id="fnanchor_202"></a><a href="#footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></span>
states, in his <dfn>Sharh-i-ashk</dfn>, “Commentary
upon Love,” that <dfn>Abúdíyet</dfn>, “devotion,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_203" id="fnanchor_203"></a><a href="#footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></span>
<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pageno">242</span>
and <dfn>rubúbíyet</dfn>, “divinity,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_204" id="fnanchor_204"></a><a href="#footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></span>
both attributes of
God; as often as the manifestation of divinity came
to seize the lord of the prophetic asylum (Muhammed),
and the quality of devotion became effaced in
him, in this transitory state,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_205" id="fnanchor_205"></a><a href="#footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></span>
whatever he proffered
was the word of God. The Máulaví Mânavi says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“As the Koran came from the lips of the prophet,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whoever asserts, he said not the truth is a Kafr (infidel).”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And when he arrived at the quality of divinity,
what he then uttered, this is called by them <dfn>hadís</dfn>,
“sacred saying;” further, what he said with the
<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pageno">243</span>
tongue of divinity, was a <dfn>hadís</dfn>. The meaning of the
words “from <dfn>Jabríil</dfn>” is this, that between these
two qualities (devotion and divinity), is a mind which
in the manifestation of divinity is giving information
from divinity, but in the quality of divinity there
is nothing intervening between itself:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_206" id="fnanchor_206"></a><a href="#footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></span>
hence it is
said:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“In love there is no message intervening:</div>
  <div class="i0">It was itself which acted as its own messenger.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The sagacious Súfís say, that what causes the
revelation of the original Being in the gradations of
divinity and in the wisdom of a book, and his
appearance in whatever form, is the manifestation
of his perfection, and this is of two kinds and in a
twofold degree. The first degree is manifestation
and exhibition in such a manner that whatever
exists may prove complete, and this can take place
only in the completeness of form; it is man who,
according to the terminology of this sect, is indicated
by it, that is, <em>essentiality</em>, which is the union of universalities
and particularities: it is said accordingly:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“There is nothing moist&mdash;there is nothing dry, that be not in the
manifest book (the Koran).” That is: Every thing is contained in the
Koran.</p>

<p>Without him (God) there is no strength; it is by
<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pageno">244</span>
him that every thing enters into the area of form
and evidence.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Without thee is nothing in the world;</div>
  <div class="i0">Ask from thyself, if thou desirest to know what thou art.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="center">(<span class="muchsmaller">ARABIC SENTENCE.</span>)</p>

<p class="blockquote unindent">“Every thing has an advantage, which, at the junction of its parts,
has been placed in it.”</p>

<p>The second degree is in the perfection of the
existence of forth-bringing and exhibiting; so that
every thing which exists, as it exists, is made to
appear complete.</p>

<p><dfn>The seal</dfn>, or “the last prophet,” in the terminology
of this sect, is a person, to whom this office can
be appropriated, and from whom the great business
may proceed; but, in forthcoming it is not allowed
to him to be, in form,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_207" id="fnanchor_207"></a><a href="#footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></span>
all-sufficient in dignity, and
in showing this form in the world; this is not confined
to a single person; but if this excellence is
manifested around, it is acknowledged as <span class="title">the seal</span> of
dignity in this age. When this condition is established,
then, by the before-said interpretation, the
moon is said to be the symbol realised in this form,
because, in the style of eloquence, it is generally
usual to interpret the form of perfection by that of
the moon, and “to divide the moon,” means in
figurative language to elicit thoroughly the sense
<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pageno">245</span>
from this form, without taking into consideration
the instruments of imitation and the arrangement
of artful contrivances. Thus was it with regard to
the promised lord of the prophetic asylum. The
lord Imâm Muhammed <span class="title">núrbakhsh</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_208" id="fnanchor_208"></a><a href="#footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></span>
“the light-bestower,”
in his treatise upon the ascent to heaven,
stated: “Know that the lord Muhammed, the
Selected (peace be with him!) ascended to heaven
with a body, but this body was light, like that
assumed in a dream, with which he went into a
state of trance, which is an intermediate state<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_209" id="fnanchor_209"></a><a href="#footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></span>
between
sleeping and waking, and on that account it
is said in the first tradition of the ascent:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I was between sleeping and waking.”</p>

<p>And further:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“God directed thee in the explanation of things revealed to the prophets
and saints, upon whom be peace!”</p>

<p class="unindent">That his being carried from the mosque of Mecca to
the mosque of Jerusalem, is an image of the migration
<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pageno">246</span>
of the terrestrial angels from one place to another.
To keep the Imámate (or presidence) during
worship is to the prophet an image, that in his
religion there are many heirs of the prophet, who
are the saints and learned men of the age.</p>

<p><dfn>Borák</dfn>, the vehicle of devotion, is like an image of
prayer; the saddle and bridle represent the ready
mind and the perfect union of religion. The members
of Borák, of precious jewels, typify purity,
candor, affection, submission, humility, and perfect
love of God, rejecting all other desire except that
tending towards the supreme Being in prayer. The
restiveness of Borak, and the aid given by Jabríil in
mounting Borák present a similitude of the reluctance
of the human mind to the wisdom of its
knowledge of God, and Jabríil figures the science of
divinity.</p>

<p>The <dfn>travelling by steps up to heaven</dfn>, means the gradual
elevation by steps, which are remembrance,
rosary-beads, praising and magnifying by exclamation,
God and the like, by which the heart arrives
from this nether world of sensuality to the upper
world.</p>

<p>By <dfn>the first heaven</dfn>, which is that of the moon, is
understood the arrival at the station of cordiality.
The opening of the heavenly door by an angel, and
the appearance of Jabríil, is figuratively the victory
of the heart over remembrance, as will be explained
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pageno">247</span>
in the sequel. The arriving at the heaven of <dfn>Aĺ áred</dfn>,
“Mercury,” is the image of elevation on the
regions of cordiality on account of meditation on the
knowledge of God, as<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“One hour’s meditation is preferable to seventy years of exterior
worship.”</p>

<p>The arrival at the heaven of <dfn>Zaherah</dfn>, “Venus,”
signifies elevation of the upper angels, on account of
the delight and beatitude which are produced in the
interior by the love of God. The arrival at the
heaven of the <dfn>sun</dfn> is to be interpreted as the elevation
in the inner sense, on account of accomplishing the
precepts of the faith, and the promulgated orders,
which are derived from it. The arrival at the heaven
of <dfn>Meríkh</dfn>, “Mars,” denotes the elevation which
may have taken place in consequence of the war
made upon the spirit of fraud. The arrival at the
heaven of <dfn>Mishterí</dfn>, “Jupiter,” offers an image of
the elevation on account of purity, piety, and abstinence
from any thing doubtful, which are manifested
by these steps. The arrival at the heaven of <dfn>Zehel</dfn>,
“Saturn,” is to be understood as the elevation from
the state of spirituality to that of mystery by the
blessing of exertion and sanctity, by choice or by
force, which means overcoming a difficulty.</p>

<p>The arrival at <dfn>Falek sábetab</dfn>, “the heaven of the
<em>fixed stars</em>,” is an image of the elevation by the
blessing of firmness in the faith, and evident proof
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pageno">248</span>
of diligent permanency in good practices, and fidelity
in the love of God and of the people of God. The
arrival at <dfn>Falek atlas</dfn>, “the <em>crystalline sphere</em>,” is to
be interpreted as the elevation to the utmost boundary
of the angels by the blessing of interior purity,
and a heart free from all desire except that after
God.</p>

<p>The <dfn>remaining behind of Borák</dfn>, the <dfn>arch</dfn>, and <dfn>Jabríil</dfn>,
in each station indicate the meaning, that in
the worlds of the upper spirits, and the empyreal
heaven, there are certain extents of spiritual faculties,
and limits of imagination, so that no body can
deviate from the station of comprehension, and</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The place of his acquisition is a place known.”</p>

<p>The explanation of this is, that, as the elemental
body cannot deviate from the elemental world, and
the soul, however composed it may be, cannot make
a step out of the nether dominion, as well as the
heart cannot leave the outer skirts of the upper
angelic courts, so that the mystery never comes
forth from the middle of the upper dominion, and
the spirit cannot make a step out of the extreme ends
of the upper regions into the <dfn>âalem-i-jabrút</dfn>, “the
highest empyreal heaven,” and the hidden cannot
transgress the empyreal world. Hence proceeds
the sense of <dfn>ghaib al ghaiyûb</dfn>, “evanescence of evanescences,”
the <em>mysterious</em> hidden.</p>

<p><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pageno">249</span>
The <span class="title">Enka</span>, upon the mount <span class="place">Kâf</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_210" id="fnanchor_210"></a><a href="#footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></span>
is divinity, and
there is annihilation into God. He does not allow
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pageno">250</span>
plurality nor partnership of eternal beauty and
strength, and from that exalted station there is no
descent. When a bird or man is annihilated, a
name is always without a designate object. <dfn>Vás el</dfn>,
“the perfect master of union,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_211" id="fnanchor_211"></a><a href="#footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></span>
finds in this station
<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pageno">251</span>
by annihilation into God emancipation from
the confinement of visible existence, and acquires
with an eternal mansion the intimate connection
with God, and an exit from the garment of servitude,
and becomes endowed with divine qualities.
In the station of transition into God, Jabríil is the
image of wisdom and of manifest knowledge, on
which account it has been declared<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“There are moments when I am with God in such a manner that neither
angel nor archangel, prophet nor apostle, can attain to it.”</p>

<p>When at the time of transition, science, comprehension,
knowledge, and all qualities are cancelled
and vanish, then transitory knowledge unites with
the perfect science, the dangers of mankind are carried
off and disappear, before the rays of light of
the supreme Being. And this is the kind of knowledge
which Jabríil revealed. Above this station
resides the absolute Being. Again, ascent and descent,
and letter and sound denote the meaning that
mankind comprises all qualities&mdash;the high and the
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span class="pageno">252</span>
low; by the exigency of its united properties, at
times drowned in the ocean of unity, man is bewildered;
and, at times, yielding to this prevailing
nature, he associates with women. Know what
Shaikh Aziz Nasfy says: Men, devoted to God’s
unity declared, regarding the expression <dfn>táí asmavat</dfn>,
“the folding up heaven,” that “heaven” signifies
something that is high and of a bountiful expansion<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_212" id="fnanchor_212"></a><a href="#footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></span>
with respect to those who are below it, and
this, causing a bountiful communication, may take
place either in the spiritual or in the material world;
the bestower of the bountiful communication may be
from the latter, he may be from the former, world.
Further, any thing may be either <em>terrestrial</em> or <em>heavenly</em>.
If thou hast well conceived the sense of the
heavenly and terrestrial, know that mankind has
four <dfn>nishá</dfn>, “stages,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_213" id="fnanchor_213"></a><a href="#footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></span>
in like manner as the blasts
of the trumpet are four times repeated: because
death and life have four periods. In the first stage,
man is living under the form of a thing; but, with
respect to qualities and reason, he is a dead thing.
In the second stage, under the form of mind, he is
a living thing, but, with respect to qualities and reason,
a dead thing. In the third stage, under the
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pageno">253</span>
form of mind, qualities he is a living thing, but,
with respect to reason, a dead thing. In the fourth
stage, under the form of mind, qualities, and reason,
he is a living thing. In the first stage, he is
entirely in the sleep of ignorance, darkness, and
stupidity, as</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Darkness upon darkness&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="unindent">In this stage he awakes from the first sleep; in the
second stage, from the second; in the third, from
the third sleep; in the fourth stage, from the last
sleep; and in this awaking of the heart he becomes
thoroughly and entirely awake, and acquires
perfect possession of himself, and knows
positively that all he had known in the three preceeding
stages was not so: because truth, having
been but imaginary, was falsehood; and that heaven
and earth, as they had been understood before,
were not so. Further, in this stage, earth will not
be that earth, and heaven not that heaven, which
men knew before. This is the meaning of the
words:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On the day when the earth shall be changed into something else
than the earth, as well as the heaven, and when all that shall be manifested
by the power of God, the only one, the Almighty.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_214" id="fnanchor_214"></a><a href="#footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>And when they arrived at that station and possessed
positively the form of mind, qualities, and
reason of an individual, certainly they knew by
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pageno">254</span>
means of revelation and inspiration, that except one
there is no being, and this being is God, the glorious
and sublime; they were informed of the real state
of things from the beginning to the utmost extremity.
In the account concerning the obscuration
of the moon, and sun, and stars, they said: that
stars have their meaning from the beginning of the
light, which is produced in the hearts of the intelligent
and select; that the sun denotes the utmost
fulness and universality of light; and that the moon,
a mediator between the sun and the star,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_215" id="fnanchor_215"></a><a href="#footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></span>
from all
sides, spreads their tidings. Then the sun is the
universal bestower of abundant blessings; the moon
is in one respect “a benefactor,” in another respect,
“benefitted.” As often as the sun’s light, which
is the universal light, manifests and spreads itself,
unity of light comes forth; the light of the moon
and that of the stars is effaced by the light of the
sun. From the beginning, the prophet says,
that<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“When the stars shall fall,</p>

<p>And in the midst,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“When the moon shall be obscured,”</p>

<p>And when the select associate with the bestower of
abundant blessings, that</p>

<p class="blockquote">“When the sun and moon shall unite,”</p>

<p class="unindent"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pageno">255</span>
there remains no trace of <dfn>istifáset</dfn>, “diffusion,” nor
of <dfn>afáset</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_216" id="fnanchor_216"></a><a href="#footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></span>
“profusion.”</p>

<p class="blockquote">“When the sun shall be folded up.”</p>

<p>It was said that the earth of the last judgment
signifies that earth on which the creatures of the
world will be assembled, and that earth is the existing
mankind, because the permanence of all beings
is not possible upon any other earth. Further,
there will be the day of the last judgment, and the
presence of the inhabitants of the world is not intended,
nor possible, upon any other earth but the
actual earth of mankind. Moreover there will be
Friday,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_217" id="fnanchor_217"></a><a href="#footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></span>
and truth will be separated from falsehood
upon no other earth but upon the earth of the actual
mankind. Then, there will be the day of the last
judgment, and no mystery among mysteries will be
manifested upon any other earth but that of actual
mankind. Afterwards, there will be the day of ripping
open the secrets, and upon no earth will a retribution
be given to any body but upon the earth of
the actual mankind. Finally, there will be the day
of faith.</p>

<p>The lord durvish Sabjány gave the information,
saying: With the Súfí’s heaven is beauty; certainly
the other world of objects of beauty is to be referred
to the beauty of God; and in hell there is majesty;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_218" id="fnanchor_218"></a><a href="#footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></span>
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">256</span>
necessarily the other world of objects of majesty
is referrible to that of God; and the <dfn>Jelálían</dfn>, or
“those to whom majesty applies,” will be satisfied in
like manner as the <dfn>Jemálian</dfn>, “those to whom beauty
appertains.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_219" id="fnanchor_219"></a><a href="#footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></span>
Further, it is said, hell is the place
of punishment; this means that if an object of beauty
be joined to majesty, it becomes disturbed; in like
manner majesty is made uneasy by beauty. From
the lord Sabjáni comes also the information that the
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pageno">257</span>
sagacious declare: Phârâoh was worthy of the name
of God, and in him the establishment of divinity
gained predominance, as well as in Moses the establishment
of divine mission. On that account the
lord Imám of the professors of divine unity, the
Shaikh <span class="person">Mahí-eddin</span> gave in several of his compositions
the proof of Pharáoh’s faith, and declared him to
be a worthy object of <em>veneration</em>, as well as Moses.
It is said also, that the land of Arafat<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_220" id="fnanchor_220"></a><a href="#footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></span>
signifies
the land, which is sought by those who made a vow,
and conceived the desire, of pilgrimage, and with
their face turned towards this land, with the utmost
effort and endeavor proceed upon their way and
journey; if in this country they meet with the day
of <dfn>Arirfah</dfn>, that is, “the ninth day of the moon,”
and accomplish the pilgrimage, they are then considered
as having become pilgrims, and to have
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span class="pageno">258</span>
found the fruit of their journey, and fulfilled their
desire, as is said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“He who reaches the mount Arafah has accomplished the pilgrimage.”</p>

<p>If they have not arrived in this land on the said
day, they have not accomplished the pilgrimage,
they have not become pilgrims nor fulfilled their
desire. If this matter be well understood, it necessarily
follows that the land of Arifát signifies the
actual earth of mankind, because all beings, heavenly
and earthly, are upon the way of travelling,
until they arrive at the dignity of mankind, and when
they arrive at it, their journey and voyage is accomplished.
If on this earth, which is that of the actual
mankind, they arrive on the day of Aráfat, which
means the knowledge of God, they have attained
their wish at the Kâbah, they have accomplished
their pilgrimage, and become pilgrims.</p>

<p><dfn>Haj</dfn>, in the Dictionary, is interpreted <dfn>kaśed</dfn>, “aspiring to,”
and <dfn>kaśed</dfn>, in the law, means the
house which Ibrahim the prophet (the blessing of
God be upon him!) built in Mecca, and, in truth, this
means the house of God, according to these words:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Neither the earth nor the heavens can contain me, but only the heart
of the believing servant.”</p>

<p>Besides, the Mobed says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“At the time of prayer the dignity of man is shown;</div>
  <div class="i0">Profit by this time, as perhaps fate may seize it.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The sagacious Súfís said: Every action of the
<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a><span class="pageno">259</span>
actions commanded by law denotes a mystery of the
mysteries. <dfn>Ghasel</dfn>, “bathing,” means coming forth
by resignation from foreign dependence. <dfn>Waśu</dfn>,
“ablution,” indicates abandonment of great occupations.
<dfn>Mazmaza</dfn>, “rinsing the mouth,” refers to
the rapture caused by the sweetness of remembrance.
<dfn>Istinsak</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_221" id="fnanchor_221"></a><a href="#footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></span>
“washing the nostrils three
times, by inhaling water out of the palm of the
hand,” denotes inhaling the perfumes of divine
bounty. <dfn>Istinsar</dfn>, “drawing up water through the
nostrils and discharging it again,” signifies throwing
off blameable qualities. <dfn>Washing the face</dfn>, has
the meaning of turning our face to God. <dfn>Washing
the hand</dfn> is withholding the hand from prohibited
things. <dfn>Washing the feet</dfn> has reference to giving
precedence to diligence upon the carpet of devotion.
<dfn>Standing upright</dfn> signifies experience in the
earthly station. <dfn>To be turned towards the Kiblah</dfn> is a
sign of offering supplications to the divine majesty.
<dfn>Joining both hands</dfn> denotes the bond of an obligatory
engagement. <dfn>Keeping the hands open during prayers</dfn>
means holding back the hand from all except what
relates to God. The <dfn>Takbír</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_222" id="fnanchor_222"></a><a href="#footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></span>
“pious exclamation,”
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pageno">260</span>
signifies respect to divine commands. <dfn>Kerát</dfn>, <dfn>chanting</dfn>
(the Koran or prayers), is perusing the divine
signets upon the tables of fate, preserved in the
heart by means of the interpretation of the tongue,
and the renewal of information upon the boundaries
of commanded and prohibited things. <dfn>Rukuâ</dfn>,
“bowing the head with the hands upon the knees,”
represents the state of resignation and submission.
<dfn>Sajúd</dfn>, “prostration,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_223" id="fnanchor_223"></a><a href="#footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></span>
indicates investigation of the
divine Being, and dismissal of all pretension. <dfn>Tashahhud</dfn>,
“ritual profession of religion,” refers to the
state of resignation and humility. <dfn>To sit down and
to stand up before God five times</dfn> means understanding
and appreciating the five majesties, which are:
divinity, grandeur, dominion, power, and love of
humanity. <dfn>Two rikâts</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_224" id="fnanchor_224"></a><a href="#footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></span>
“attitudes of devotion in
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pageno">261</span>
“the morning,” are indicative of God’s absolute
being and of reality. <dfn>Four rikâts</dfn> relate to four effulgencies,
which are impressiveness, agency, inherence
of attributes, and substantiality. <dfn>Three rikâts</dfn>,
imply separation, union, and union of unions, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>:
<dfn>separation</dfn>, in viewing the creatures without God;
<dfn>union</dfn>, in viewing God without the creatures; and
<dfn>union of unions</dfn>, in viewing God in the creatures, and
the creatures in God; so that the view of the one
may not to the heart be a veil to the view of the
other. <dfn>Keeping the fast</dfn> refers to the purity of the
interior. <dfn>The sight of halál</dfn>, “the new moon,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_225" id="fnanchor_225"></a><a href="#footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></span>
is
seeing the eye-brows of the perfect spiritual guide.
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pageno">262</span>
<dfn>Aíd</dfn>, “a feast,” is the knowledge of God. <dfn>Kurban</dfn>,
“sacrificing”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_226" id="fnanchor_226"></a><a href="#footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></span>
(killing victims), denotes annihilating
the brutal spirit. <dfn>Rozah</dfn>, “fasting,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_227" id="fnanchor_227"></a><a href="#footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></span>
has three
degrees. The first degree is guarding the belly and
the sexual organs from what is improper; the second
degree is guarding one’s self from unbecoming
words and deeds; the third degree is guarding the
heart from whatever is contrary to God. <dfn>Jahad</dfn>,
“holy war upon unbelievers,” signifies combating
the spirit of deceit. <dfn>Múmen</dfn>, “right faith,” implies
adherence to whatever is essential to the true worship
of God, and tendency to it by any way which
God wills, for<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“The road towards the idols is formed of the great number of sighs of
the creatures.”</p>

<p>The lord <span class="person">Aín ul-Kazat</span> said, he has learned upon
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pageno">263</span>
his way, that the essence of all creeds is God, and
that of all creeds of the sophists is this:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“All shall perish except his countenance (that is God’s); all that is
upon the earth is perishable.”</p>

<p>And the meaning of the verse of the merciful is,
that at a certain time he will be nothing, because on
that very day all is nothing and this very opinion
is the principal part of the creed of sharp-sighted
men. In the <cite>takwiyat mâni</cite>, “the strengthening of
sense,” the lord <span class="person">Aín ul Kazat</span>, <dfn>saheb-i zúkí</dfn>, “possessor
of delight,” said that the mood of the verbal
noun is in progressive efficiency at all times, whilst
perdition of all things at all times is also constant,
but has no determined future time: consequently
this perdition, which is an indetermined tense,
does not imply that the contingent efficiency is perdition
in a future time.</p>

<p>The Imám <span class="person">Muhammed Núr bakhsh</span> stated, that all
those who are reckoned to have seen God as particular
servants near to him, have said the truth;
because the rational spirit, which means that of
mankind, is pure and uncompounded; on that account
it is not prevented from seeing God, and those
who speak against the sight are also right, because
the eye cannot see the mysterious blessed Being on
account of his solitude. An investigator of truth
has said: Those who assert the solitude of God
are right: because the blessed Being is solitary.
<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pageno">264</span>
And those who speak of his corporeity, and consider
God as one of the bodies, such as fire, air, water, or
earth, say right, because he is in every sort of
beings. Likewise, those who hold him to be good
or bad, are not wrong; because nothing exists without
him, so that what happens can happen but by
his order. And those who ascribe the bad to themselves
are right, because in practice they are the
movers of their works. So it is with other opinions,
such as those who consider God as a Father
with regard to all existing beings, and this opinion
is true.</p>

<p>The Sonnites recognise Abu Bekr (may God reward
him), as a khalif on the strength of his perfection:
this is sufficiently founded. But the Shíâhs
oppose that on the supposition of his deficiencies.
Besides, every body may, conformably to
his own conceptions, have some objection to Abu
Bekr. In the same manner, concerning the future
state, there are contradictory creeds of nations, and
histories of their princes in the world adopted as
certain. All these contradictions of the inhabitants
of this world are to be considered in this point of
view&mdash;that they are <em>more or less</em> belonging to truth.</p>

<p>The Súfís maintain that <dfn>vilayet</dfn>, “holiness,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_228" id="fnanchor_228"></a><a href="#footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></span>
in
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pageno">265</span>
the Dictionary signifies vicinity (to God), and in the
public circle to be chosen by the people of God, is
evident prophetic mission, and interior faith is incitement
to prophecy; the prophet is its faith, and the
incitement of the faith of a saint is the mission of a
prophet, and the faith of an apostle is the completion
of the apostleship. Inspiration takes place
without the intervention of an angel, and revelation
with the intervention of an angel is the revelation
appropriate to the prophet. Inspiration is also
appropriate to him.</p>

<p>The pious Sajan Sajání says, the perfection of
sanctity is the period of a <span class="title">Mahdí</span>’s time; hence all
those among the saints who claimed the dignity of
a Mahdi, were divine. In the same manner as every
<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span class="pageno">266</span>
malady of the body has a curative medicine, so every
malady of the spirit has also its means of cure.
Thus, as the pulse and the urine are indicative of
the state of bodies, so dream and vision indicate the
state of the spirit. On that account, the devotees
relate the visions to their Shaíkh, who is the doctor
of the soul.</p>

<p>The Súfís say, that upon the way of pilgrimage
there are seven <dfn>mertebah</dfn>, “degrees.” The first degree
consists of penitence, obedience, and meditation,
and in this degree the light is, as it were, green.
The second degree is <dfn>the purity of the spirit</dfn> from satanic
qualities, violence, and brutality; because, as
long as the spirit is the slave of satanic qualities, it
is subject to concupiscence, and this is the quality
of fire. In this state Iblis evinces his strength, and
when the spirit is liberated from this, it is distressed
with the quality of fierceness, which may be said
<dfn>flashing</dfn>, and this is conformable to the property of
wind. Then it becomes insatiable,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_229" id="fnanchor_229"></a><a href="#footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></span>
and this is
similar to water. After this it obtains quietness,
and this quality resembles earth.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_230" id="fnanchor_230"></a><a href="#footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></span>
In the degree of
repose, the light is as it were blue, and the utmost
<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a><span class="pageno">267</span>
reach of one’s progress is the earthly dominion. The
third degree is <dfn>the manifestation of the heart</dfn>, by laudable
qualities, which is similar to red light, and the
utmost reach of its progress is the middle of the
upper dominion; and in this station the heart praises
God, and sees the light of worship and spiritual
qualities. With the pure Súfís, “the heart” signifies
the form of moderation which keeps the mind
in such dispositions that it may not at all be inclined
to any side towards excess and redundancy, and the
possessor of his mind whose fortunate lot is such a
station, is praised as “the master of the heart,” or
“the lord of the mind.” The fourth degree is the
<dfn>applying of the constitution to nothing else but to God</dfn>, and
this is similar to yellow light, and the utmost reach
of its progress is the midst of the heavenly <dfn>malkut</dfn>,
“dominion.” The fifth degree of the soul is that
<dfn>which resembles white light</dfn>, and the utmost aim of its
progress is the extreme heavenly dominion. The
sixth degree is <dfn>the hidden</dfn>, which is like a black light,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_231" id="fnanchor_231"></a><a href="#footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></span>
and the utmost reach of its progress is the <dfn>âálemi jabrút</dfn>,
“the world of power.” The seventh degree is
<dfn>ghaiyúb al ghaiyúb</dfn>, “the evanescence of evanescence,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_232" id="fnanchor_232"></a><a href="#footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></span>
<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pageno">268</span>
which is <dfn>faná</dfn>, “annihilation,” and <dfn>baka</dfn>,
“eternal life,” and is colorless; this is absorption
in God, non-existence, and effacement of the imaginary
in the true being, like the loss of a drop of
water in the ocean; and “eternal life” is the union
of the drop with the sea, and abstraction from all
except the proper view of the heart, or separation
from the idle images which prevented the <dfn>salik</dfn>, “traveller,”
in the midst of existence from distinguishing
the drop from the ocean. <dfn>Faná</dfn>, “annihilation,”
is of two kinds: partial, and universal.
The partial consists in this: that a traveller is effaced
at once, or that, by gradation, several of his members
are effaced, and then the rest of his members.
The senses and faculties pass first through the
exigency of <dfn>sukr</dfn>, “intoxication,” and, secondly,
through that of <dfn>sahu</dfn>, “recovery from ebriety.”
The universal annihilation consists in this: that all
existences belonging to the worlds of <dfn>malik</dfn>, <dfn>malkut</dfn>,
<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pageno">269</span>
and <dfn>jabrút</dfn>, “of the angels, of dominion, and
power,” are effaced at once, or by gradation:
first, the three kingdoms of nature are effaced; then
the elements; further the heavens; afterwards, <dfn>malkut</dfn>,
“dominion;” finally, <dfn>jabrut</dfn>, “power.” Proceeding,
the traveller experiences first the exigency
of a sudden manifestation<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_233" id="fnanchor_233"></a><a href="#footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></span>
of majesty, and, secondly,
that of beauty.</p>

<p>The author of this book heard from the durvish
Sabjání, that what the prophet has revealed, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>:
“<cite>that earth and heaven will go to perdition</cite>,” signifies
“annihilation,” not as people take it in the common
acceptation, but in a higher sense, “annihilation in
God;” so that God with all his attributes manifests
itself to the pious person, who becomes entirely
annihilated. Eternal life, which is the opposite of
<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a><span class="pageno">270</span>
annihilation, has also four divisions. The first degree
is eternal existence with God, when the pious
person from the absorption in God returns, and
sees himself <dfn>âyin vajud</dfn>, “a real being,” endowed
with all qualities<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Who has seen himself, saw God.”</p>

<p>If in absorption he keeps consciousness, there
remains duality behind.</p>

<p>In the abridged commentary upon <cite>Gulshen raz</cite>, it
is stated, that there are four kinds of manifestations.
The first is <dfn>ásárí</dfn>, “impression,” by which the absolute
being appears under the form of some corporeal
beings, among which the human form is the most
perfect. The second kind is <dfn>Afâalí</dfn>, “belonging to
action,” when the contemplative person sees the
absolute being endowed with several attributes of
action, such as creator, or nourisher, and the like,
or sees himself a being endowed with one of the
attributes. The manifestations are frequently colored
with lights, and exhibit all sorts of tints. The
third kind is <dfn>sifátí</dfn>, “belonging to attributes,” when
the contemplative person sees the absolute being
endowed with the attributes of his own essence, such
as science and life, or sees himself a real being, endowed
with these attributes. The fourth kind is
<dfn>zatí</dfn>, “essence,” in which, on account of manifestation,
annihilation takes place, so that the possessor
of this manifestation participates in a condition in
<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pageno">271</span>
which no trace of himself remains, and no consciousness
whatever is preserved. It is not necessary that
the manifestation be colored in a vest of light, or
that every light be a light of manifestation. It may
happen that a light proceeds from a prophet, a
saint, or a creature. The symptom of manifestation
is annihilation, or the science (that is intimate
knowledge) of the object manifested at the time of
manifestation. The evidence for the truth of manifestations
is derived from the Koran, or from traditions.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I am God, the Lord of creatures.”</p>

<p>Moses heard the voice from a bush,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_234" id="fnanchor_234"></a><a href="#footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></span>
and the
chosen prophet said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I saw my Lord under the most excellent form.”</p>

<p><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a><span class="pageno">272</span>
The writer of these pages heard from the durvish
Sabjáni that the Hindus and other nations, having
formed and adored as Gods various different images,
this is founded upon the fact, that eminent persons
among them were impressed with manifestations;
and in such a manner the ten ávatárs became the
counterfeits of these manifestations; some of the
ávatárs held themselves to be divinities; because
they have been the masters of these manifestations;
that the Jews and other nations acknowledge God
under bodily forms proceeds from the like manifestations.
Besides, that Pharâoh declared himself to
be a God, comes from a like manifestation:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_235" id="fnanchor_235"></a><a href="#footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></span>
because
Pharáoh, under his own form had seen God; on
that account the lord Imám Múheddín Shaikh Mahí-eddín,
in some of his compositions, exhibited proofs
of Pharâoh’s religion, and rendered this personage
<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a><span class="pageno">273</span>
illustrious. Moses saw God under a bodily form,
and did not find himself like that (exalted) being;
but it was under his own form that Pharâoh saw
God, and found himself like that being. Jesus
declared himself the son of God; because he found
himself the son of God Almighty, in a like manifestation.</p>

<p><dfn>Hajab</dfn>, “the veil,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_236" id="fnanchor_236"></a><a href="#footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></span>
is of two kinds: the one, of
darkness, is that of a servant, like morality and exterior
occupations and the other is the veil of light
which comes from God; because traditions are veils
of actions; actions, veils of attributes; and attributes,
veils of the essence of revelation, which relates
to mystery, dependent either upon exterior
<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pageno">274</span>
form or inner sense. The first kind of truth is called
<dfn>Kashef surí</dfn>, the “exterior revelation;” the second
kind is the <dfn>Kashef mâní</dfn>, “inner revelation.” The
exterior revelation takes place by means of sight,
hearing, touch, smell, or rapture, and is dependent
upon temporal traditions; this is called <dfn>rahbániyet</dfn>,
“way-guarding,” because the finding of truth
according to investigation is contemplation, and
some reckon this investigation among the sorts of
<dfn>istidráj</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_237" id="fnanchor_237"></a><a href="#footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></span>
“miracles permitted by God for hardening
the hearts of sinners,” and of <dfn>makr Ilahí</dfn>, “divine
fascination.”</p>

<p>Some derived the commands relative to the other
world from the revelation, and confined their desires
to <dfn>faná</dfn>, “annihilation, and <dfn>baká</dfn>, “eternal
life.” The author of this book heard from Sabjana
that the exterior revelation concerning temporal
actions is called “monastic institution,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_238" id="fnanchor_238"></a><a href="#footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></span>
because
<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><span class="pageno">275</span>
monks belong to the exterior people; and its worship
is, according to rules, relative to every thing
exterior; and its purpose, on account of service,
directed to the retribution of deeds, reward of heaven,
adherence to a particular prophet, and the
like. Further obedience is an indication which
bears towards temporal actions; on that account its
revelation is connected with temporal concerns.
The devout Muselman follows also the rule of monastic
life, and the Christian is not without participation
in absorption and eternal life.</p>

<p>It is to be known that in the service of a king
there are two confidential Amirs, who are not friends,
but entertain enmity against each other. They
may bring their own friends before the king. So
are the prophets appointed at the court <em>of God</em>; if
not so, how would the absolute Being have divided
the extent of his empire by religion, if this were to
be confined to one person? Another opinion is that
of a pious philosopher, who contemplates the light
of God in all objects of this and the other world,
and turns not his regard from the least atom; he
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pageno">276</span>
raised this belief to a high estimation; and to him
remained no rancor of creed or religion; whoever,
in the service of faith and morality is not freed from
duality, and whoever says, the state of Muselmans
is in dignity higher than that of Christians, knows
nothing of the real Being. Whoever said of himself:
“I attained a height of knowledge equal to
that of <span class="person">Mâruf Kerkhi</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_239" id="fnanchor_239"></a><a href="#footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></span>
said nothing else than this:
the variety and multitude of the rules of prophets
proceed only from the abundance of names, and,
as in names there is no mutual opposition or contradiction,
the superiority in rank among them
is only the predominance of a name.”</p>

<p>The Súfis say: The spirits of the perfect men<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_240" id="fnanchor_240"></a><a href="#footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></span>
<a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pageno">277</span>
after separation from their bodies, go to the world of
angels. The saints are directed by the interpretation
of the Korán, and the vulgar people by the
commentary upon both. Some maintain that the
Saints do not subject themselves to it, but are tenacious
only of this verse:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Adore God, thy Lord, until attaining certitude (himself).”</p>

<p>The Shaikh Nájem eddin Kabra<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_241" id="fnanchor_241"></a><a href="#footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></span>
said: When distinguished
persons abandon the ceremonies of the
worship, this means that these ceremonies which
are performed by prescription, are contrary to them,
because in worship no difficulty or inconvenience is
to take place, but only joy and pleasure to be derived
from it.</p>

<p>The lord Saíd Muhammed Nurbakhsh says, in the
account of apparitions: The difference between
<dfn>baroz</dfn>, “apparition,” and <dfn>tanásokh</dfn>, “transmigration,”
is this: that the latter is the arrival of the
soul, when it has separated from one body to take
possession of another, in the embryo which is fit
<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a><span class="pageno">278</span>
for receiving a soul in the fourth month, to be reckoned
from the moment when the sperma fell and
settled in the womb; and this separation from one
body and junction with another is called <dfn>maâd</dfn>,
“resurrection.” An “apparition” is when a soul
accumulates excellence upon excellence and an
overflow takes place; so that by beatific vision it
becomes visible; that is, it may happen, that a perfect
soul, after its separation from the body, resides
years in the upper world, and afterwards, for the
sake of perfecting mankind, joins with a body, and
the time of this junction is also the fourth month to
be reckoned from the moment of the formation of
the body, as was said upon transmigration.</p>

<p>It is stated, in the abridged commentary upon Gulshen-raz,
that the soul cannot be without a body.
When it is separated from the elemental body, it
becomes a shadowy figure in the <dfn>barzakh</dfn>, that is, in
the interval of time between the death and the resurrection
of a man;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_242" id="fnanchor_242"></a><a href="#footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></span>
this is called “the acquired
body.” The barzakh, to which the soul is transported
after its separation from this world, is another
place than that which is between the spirits and the
bodies. The first is called <dfn>ghaib imkaní</dfn>, “the possible
disappearance,” and the second <dfn>ghaib maháli</dfn>,
“the illusive disappearance.” All those who experience
the possible disappearance, become informed
<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pageno">279</span>
of future events. There are many contradictory
opinions about the illusive disappearance, which is
the annunciation of the tidings of an extraordinary
death. The lord Shaikh Muhammed Láhejí stated,
in his commentary upon Gulshen-raz, that in the
histories and accounts before-said is to be found,
that <span class="place">Jábilká</span> is a town of immense magnitude in the
East, and <span class="place">Jábilsá</span> a town of the utmost extent in the
West, opposite to the former.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_243" id="fnanchor_243"></a><a href="#footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></span>
Commentators have
said a great deal upon both. According to the impressions
which I, an humble person, have received
upon my mind relative to this subject, without copying
others, and conformably with the indications,
there are two places; the one, <span class="place">Jábilká</span> is <dfn>âalemi-misal</dfn>,
the “world of images,” because on the east side
the spirits emerge into existence. Barzakh (another
name for it) is between the invisible and the visible,
and contains every image of the world; certainly
there may be a town of immense greatness, and
<dfn>Jábilsá</dfn> is “the world of similitude.” Barzakh is
there the world in which the souls reside after their
separation from the worldly station, all suitably to
their deeds, manners, and words, good or bad, which
<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pageno">280</span>
they had made their own in the worldly station, as
is to be found in the sacred verses and traditions.
This Barzakh is on the west side of the material
world, and is certainly a town of immense greatness,
and opposite to it is Jábilká. The inhabitants
of this town are gentle and just, whilst the
people of Jábilsá, on account of the wicked deeds
and manners which they had made their own in the
worldly station, well deserve to be distinguished by
the title of oppressors. Many entertain the opinion
that both Barzakhs are but one; it should however
be stated, that Barzakh in which the souls will
abide after their separation from the worldly station
is to the right of that Barzakh which is placed, between
the pure spirits and the bodies: because the
gradations of the descent and ascent of beings form
a circle, in which the junction of the last with the
first point cannot be imagined but in the movement
of the circle, and that Barzakh which is prior to the
worldly station, with regard to the graduated descent,
has a connection with the anterior worldly
station; and that Barzakh, which is posterior to the
worldly station, with regard to the graduated ascent,
has a connection with the posterior worldly station.
Further, whatever be the form of manners of the
souls in the posterior Barzakh, this will also be the
form of deeds, consequences of manners, actions,
and qualities which had been owned in the worldly
<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pageno">281</span>
station, in opposition to the former Barzakh. Then
the one is a stranger to the other; however, as both
worlds, inasmuch as spiritual essences of light, being
different from matter, are comprised in the visionary
forms of the universe, they may be taken for synonimous.
The Shaikh Dáúd Káíśerí relates that
Shaikh Mahi-eddin of Arabia (may his tomb be purified!)
has stated in the <cite>Fatúhál</cite>, “revelations,” that
<dfn>Barzakh</dfn> is different from the first; and the reason
that the first is distinguished by the name of “possible
absence,” and the latter by “illusive absence,”
is, that every form in the first Barzakh
is contingent, and depends upon exterior evidence,
and every form in the last Barzakh, is inaccessible
<em>to the senses</em>, and admits of no evidence but on the
last day of the world. There are many expounders
to whom the form of the first Barzakh appears evident,
and who know what takes place in the world
of accidents; however, few of these expounders are
informed of the news of death.</p>

<p>The author of this book heard from Sabjáni, the
learned in the knowledge of God; that the belief of
the pure Súfis is the same as that of the <dfn>Ashrákían</dfn>,
“the Platonists;” but the Súfis have now mixed
their creed with so many glosses, that nobody finds
therein the door to the rules of the prophet, and the
ancient Saints. Sabjáni gave the information that
the essence of God Almighty is absolute light, absolute
<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pageno">282</span>
brightness, and mysterious life; that he is pure,
and free from all colors, figures, shapes, and without
a prototype; that the interpretation of the eloquent
and the indications of the learned are deficient in
the account of that light which is without color and
mark; that the understanding of the learned and the
wisdom of the sage is too weak for entirely comprehending
the pure essence of that light, and as, conformably
to these words:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I was a hidden treasure; but I wished to be known, and I created
the world for being known.”</p>

<p>The essence of God the most High and Almighty
showed his existence, so that, except him, there is
no real being. In this employment of manifestation,
he entered into contemplation, whence the sage
calls him the first intelligence; because this lord of
expansive creation considered every being according
to the scope of propriety; and when the Almighty
Being of expansive creation had examined every
form inasmuch as by his power it was possible that
such a form might appear, he fixed his contemplation
in this employment of manifestation, so that
what is called “the perfect spirit” is nothing else
but himself. From Sabjana the information has
been received and found in books that Abul Hassen
Surí said: God Almighty rendered his spirit beauteous,
then called it “truth,” and made revelations,
and brought forth names to the creatures;
<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span class="pageno">283</span>
the absolute being has two heads: the first is <dfn>itlák
sarf</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_244" id="fnanchor_244"></a><a href="#footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></span>
“absolute excellence,” and <dfn>vahedet mahs</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_245" id="fnanchor_245"></a><a href="#footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></span>
“unmixed unity;” the second is <dfn>mukayed va kasret
va badáyet</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_246" id="fnanchor_246"></a><a href="#footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></span>
“compass, abundance, and primitiveness.”
This, according to the greatest number,
relates to unity. Further is <dfn>âkl-kulli</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_247" id="fnanchor_247"></a><a href="#footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></span>
“the
universal spirit,” which incloses all realities
which are (as it were) concrete in him, and this is
called <dfn>ârsh-i-majíd</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_248" id="fnanchor_248"></a><a href="#footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></span>
“the throne of glory” (the
ninth or empyrean heaven); he is the truth of
mankind, and between him and the majesty of
divinity there is no mediator according to the wise,
although some admit a difference. Sabjání said,
this indicates that they wish no separation from the
Lord of grace may ever take place. Moreover, the
universal spirit, which embraces all realities in the
way of expansion, they call <dfn>ârsh-i-Kerim</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_249" id="fnanchor_249"></a><a href="#footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></span>
“the
throne of mercy,” and <dfn>lawh-i-mahfúz</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_250" id="fnanchor_250"></a><a href="#footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></span>
“the tables
of destiny.” Besides, there is the universal
<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a><span class="pageno">284</span>
nature, penetrating all material and spiritual beings,
and this is called <dfn>âikáb</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_251" id="fnanchor_251"></a><a href="#footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></span>
“vicissitude.” With the
philosophers nature is the noble part of bodies, and
Sajani stated, the penetrating nature in spirits indicates
and signifies that there is one divine Being,
and the rest nothing else but shadows. Finally,
there is an essence of life, which the philosophers
call <dfn>hayúli</dfn>, “the first principle of every thing material,”
and the Súfis call it <dfn>enka</dfn>.</p>

 <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">عبوديت</span> means also “servitude, submission, pious fervour;” it is
reckoned one of the most essential qualities of a saint in general. An
<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">عبد</span>, <dfn>âbid</dfn>, is a person continually occupied with religious practices,
and all sorts of supererogatory pious acts, with the view of obtaining
future beatitude. It may be asked, how can devotion, as said above, be
an attribute of God? The answer is that, according to Súfism, God is
every thing which appears praise-worthy to man, who can never forsake
his own nature. Thus says Sâdi in his fifth Sermon: “A hundred
thousand souls, alas! are the devoted slaves of the shoe-dust of that
Durvish (God).” He who prays from the inmost of his soul, grants his
prayers to himself; he no more prays, but is the God who, at the same time,
offers and accepts prayers.&mdash;(See <cite>Sufismus</cite>, by F. A. D. Tholuck, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 155.)</p>

 <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">ربوبيت</span> signifies a participation in the nature and excellence of
God, attainable by a mortal. There is a school of Súfis, called <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">الحوليت</span>
<span class="trans">Alhulíyat</span>, who think that deity may descend and penetrate into a
mortal’s mind. Muhammed is supposed to have possessed this eminent
quality of a Súfi.</p>

 Two technical words occur (among many others) of the Súfis <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">حال</span>
<span class="trans">hal</span>, and <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">مقام</span> <span class="trans">makám</span>, which require a particular explanation. <dfn>Hál</dfn>
signifies a feeling of joy or of affliction&mdash;of compression or dilatation&mdash;or
of any other condition, which takes hold of the heart without any
effort being made to produce or to provoke it, and which ceases when the
soul reverts to the consideration of its own qualities. It is so called whether
the same state be repeated or not. I generally render it by “state,”
above by “transitory state.” If it persists and is changed into an habitual
faculty, it is then called <dfn>makám</dfn>; I render it by “station.” The
<dfn>hals</dfn> are pure gifts of God; the <dfn>makáms</dfn> are fruits of labor. The first
proceed from God’s pure bounty; the second are obtained by dint of
efforts. Both words may sometimes be rendered by extasy, or extatic,
supernatural condition, in which the soul loses sight of itself to see
God only, and which ceases, as soon as its looks are directed towards itself.&mdash;(See

 We have already mentioned (<abbr title="volume One page">vol. I. p.</abbr> 55. note 1) the <dfn>Enka</dfn>, or <dfn>Simurgh</dfn>,
“thirty birds,” as an object of fabulous romance. At one time
this mysterious bird was counsellor of the Jins (genii), and for the last time
was visible at the court of Solomon, the son of David, after which he
retired to the mount <span class="place">Kaf</span>, which encircles the earth. According to a tradition
of Muhammed, God created, in the time of Moses, a female bird,
called <span class="title">Enka</span>, having wings on each side and the face of a man. God gave
it a portion of every thing, and then created a male of the same species.
They propagated after the death of Moses, feeding on ferocious beasts and
carrying away children, until the intervening time between Jesus and
Muhammed, when, at the prayer of Khaled, this race was extinguished.
Proverbially, the Enka is mentioned as a thing of which every body
speaks without having ever seen it.</p>

<p class="footnote">But a much greater import is attached to this name in the doctrine of
the Sufis: with them this bird is nothing less than the emblem of the
supreme Being, to be sought with the utmost effort and perseverance
through innumerable difficulties which obstruct the road to his mysterious
seat. This idea was ingeniously allegorized in the famous poem
entitled <cite>Mantek al tair</cite>, “the colloquy of the birds,” composed by <span class="person">Ferid-eddin
Attar</span>, a Persian poet, who was born in Kerken, a village near
Nishapúr, in the year of the Hejira 513 (A. D. 1119), and lived 110, 112,
or 115 years, having died in A. H. 627, 629, or 632 (A. D. 1229, 1231,
or 1234). In this composition, the birds, emblems of souls, assemble
under the conduct of a hoop (<dfn>upapa</dfn>), their king, in order to be presented
to Simurgh. To attain his residence, seven valleys are to be traversed;
these are: 1. the valley of research; 2. that of love; 3. that of knowledge;
4. of sufficiency (competence); 5. of unity; 6. of stupefaction;
and 7. that of poverty and annihilation, beyond which nobody can proceed;
every one finds himself attracted without being able to advance.
These are evidently as many gradations of contemplative life, and austere
virtue, each of which is described in glowing terms, for which scarce an
equivalent is to be found in European languages. The birds, having
attained the residence of Simurgh, were at first ordered back by the usher
of the royal court, but, as they persevered in their desire, the violence of
their grief met with pity. Admitted to the presence of Simurgh, they
heard the register of their faults committed towards him read to them,
and, sunk in confusion, were annihilated. But this annihilation purified
them from all terrestrial elements; they received a new life from the
light of majesty; in a new sort of stupefaction, all they had committed
during former existence was cancelled, and disappeared from their hearts;
the sun of approximation consumed, but a ray of this light revived them.
Then they perceived the face of Simurgh: “When they threw a clandestine
look upon him, they saw thirty birds in him, and when they
turned their eyes to themselves, the thirty birds appeared one Simurgh:
they saw in themselves the entire Simurgh; they saw in Simurgh the
thirty birds entirely.” They remained absorbed in this reflection.
Having then asked the solution of the problem <em>We</em> and <em>Thou</em>, that is, the
problem of apparent identity of the divinity and his adorers, they received
it, and were for ever annihilated in Simurgh: the shade vanished in the
sun.&mdash;(See <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Notices et Extraits des MSS.</cite>, <abbr title="pages volume Twelve">vol. XII. pp.</abbr> 306-312).</p>

<p class="footnote">According to the thirty-seventh and last allegory of <i>Azz-eddin Elmocadessi</i>,
an Arabian poet, who died in A. H. 678 (A. D. 1280), the assembled
birds resolved to pass a profound sea, elevated mountains, and consuming
flames, to arrive at a mysterious island where <dfn>Simurgh</dfn> or <dfn>Enka maghreb</dfn>,
“the wonderful,” resided, whom they wished to choose for their
king. After having supported the fatigues, and surmounted the difficulties
and perils of their voyage, they attained their aim, a delightful
sojourn, where they found every thing that may captivate the senses.
But when they offered their homage to Simurgh, he at first refused them,
but having tried their perseverance in their attachment to him, he at
last gratified their desire, and granted them ineffable beatitude.&mdash;(See

destroy what concerns Paradise; but this subject is touched upon but
in a superficial manner in the Dabistán, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 486. * * * * I confess,
as to the rest, that I have not yet formed to myself a very clear idea of
this theory.” He subjoins the following note: “Paradise, according
to the Dabistán is, with the Súfís, ‘the beauty of God,’ <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">جمال</span> <i>jemal</i>,
and hell, ‘the glory,’ <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">جلال</span> <span class="trans">jelal</span>; men who, by their conduct, belong

name of hell; that is the <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">جلاليان</span> <span class="trans">jelalian</span>, find pleasure in it, and
when it is said that hell is a place of torment, this means that those

be unfortunate, if they should be placed in the situation of those who
belong to the attribute of glory, the <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">جلاليان</span>; the same would be the

 Arafat is a mountain not far from Mecca. Muhammedans believe
that Adam and Eve, having been separated to perform penance,
searched for each other during a hundred and twenty or two hundred
years, until at last they met again upon the mountain <span class="place">Arafah</span>, the
name of which is derived from the Arabian verb “to know.” This is
one of the etymologies of this name; I omit others relating to Abraham
(see D’Ohsson, <abbr title="tome Two pages">t. II. pp.</abbr> 85-86). This mountain, in the pilgrimage
to Mecca, is one of the principal sacred stations, which the pilgrims
cannot enter without having taken the <dfn>Ihhram</dfn>, or “penitential veil,” on
the first day of the moon <dfn>Zílhajah</dfn> (the last of the Arabian year); on the

 The apparition of the new moon is to the Muhammedans an important
phenomenon, as it marks the beginning of their fasts, feasts, and other
religious practices, which, to be valid, must be observed exactly at the
prescribed time. On that account, the magistrates in the Musulman
empire are attentive to announce the right epoch; the <dfn>Muezins</dfn>, or
“cryers,” of the highest mosques, at the approach of the new moon pass
the whole night on the top of the minarets to observe the precise moment.
Thus, the fast of the <span class="title">Ramazan</span>, which lasts thirty days, begins at the
apparition of the new moon; the commencement of the moons <span class="title">Shewel</span>
and <span class="title">Zilhijah</span> are important for the celebration of the two only feasts in
the Muhammedan year: the first is the <dfn>âid-fitr</dfn>, “the feast of breaking
“fast,” which occupies one or three days, and seventy days after this is
the <dfn>âid-kurban</dfn>, “the feast of sacrifice,” which lasts four days: thus the
grave Muselmans allow but seven days of their whole year to festivity.
As their years are lunar, these two feasts run in the space of thirty-three
years through all the seasons of the year.&mdash;(D’Ohsson, tome <abbr title="Two page">II. p.</abbr> 227;

 The immolation of an animal in honor of the Eternal on the prescribed
day is of canonical obligation: every Muselman, free, settled, and
in easy circumstances, is bound to offer in sacrifice a sheep, an ox, or a
camel. Several persons, to the number of seven, may associate for such
a purpose. To this is added the distribution of alms to the poor, consisting
of killing one or more animals, sheep, lambs, goats, to be dressed,
a part of which is tasted by the sacrificer and his family, and the rest
given to the poor. (<cite>Ibid.</cite>, <abbr title="tome Two page">t. II. p.</abbr> 425.)</p>

 Fasting, with the Muhammedans, imposes an entire abstinence from
all food whatever, and a perfect continence during the whole day from
the first canonical hour of morning, which begins at day-break, until
sunset. There are different sorts of fasts; canonical, satisfactory, expiatory,
votive, and supererogatory. Each of them, although determined by
different motives, requires, nevertheless, the same abstinence during the
whole day.&mdash;(<cite>Ibid.</cite>, <abbr title="tome Three page">t. III. p.</abbr> 1).</p>

 A possessor of velayet, a <dfn>veli</dfn>, “a saint,” according to Jámi (in the
Lives of Súfís) is destined to serve as an instrument for manifesting the
proof of prophetic mission. Extraordinary powers over all nature are
ascribed to such a man. According to the <cite>Kashef ul mahjub</cite>, “the revelations
of the veiled being,” composed by Shaikh <span class="person">Ali Osman Ben Ebil-Ali
el Ghaznavi</span>, there are four thousand saints in the world, walking
separate from each other upon the ways of God. Among these, the first
three hundred are called <dfn>Akhyár</dfn>, “the best;” the next four hundred
are the <dfn>Abdal</dfn>, commonly called “Santons;” after them seven hundred
<dfn>Ebrar</dfn>, “just men;” further, four hundred <dfn>Awtad</dfn>, “posts or stakes;”
finally, three hundred <dfn>Nukeba</dfn>, “chosen.” According to the author of

before-mentioned (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 334, <a href="#footnote_191">note 1</a>), there exist at any time seven
<dfn>Abdal</dfn>, or Saints, who preside the seven terrestrial zones, or climates.

in the following order: Abraham, Moses, Aaron, Edris, Joseph, Jesus, and

 The bush from whence Moses heard the voice of God is mentioned in

with his family from Midian to Egypt, came to the valley of Towa,
situated near mount Sinai; his wife fell in labor and was delivered of a
son, in a very dark and snowy night; he had also lost his way, and his
cattle was scattered from him, when on a sudden he saw a fire by the side
of a mountain, which on his nearer approach he found burning in a
<em>green bush</em>. The Koran (<abbr title="chapter 20 verses">chap. XX. vv.</abbr> 9-14) says: “When he saw fire
and said to his family: Tarry ye here, for I perceive fire: peradventure
I may bring you a brand thereout, or may find a direction in our
way by the fire. And when he was come near unto it, a voice called
unto him, saying: O Moses! verily I am thy Lord: wherefore put off
thy shoes: for thou art in the sacred valley Towa. And I have chosen
thee: therefore hearken with attention unto that which is revealed unto
thee. Verily I am God; there is no God beside me: wherefore worship
me, and perform thy prayer in remembrance of me.”</p>

 The name of Pharâoh occurs several times in this work; but the character
of this personage is viewed in a different light by the sectarians of
Muhammedism. In the Koran he appears nearly as in the Bible of the
Jews, with regard to Moses and the Israelites, cruel, tyrannical, presumptuous,
and perishing in the Red Sea: not without having before acknowledged
their God, and confessed his sins. But some Súfis see and admire
in the impious daring of Pharâoh the omnipotence of his power, and
adduce, in favor of their opinion, passages from some of their most celebrated
philosophers. Indeed Jelaleddin represents Pharâoh equal to
Moses. Sahel Ibn Abd-ullah of Shostr says, that the secret of the soul was
first revealed when Pharâoh declared himself a God. Ghazáli sees in his
temerity nothing else but the most noble aspiration to the divine, innate
in the human mind.</p>

 The Súfis call <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">حجاب</span> “veil,” whatever is opposed to perfect union
with divinity. In the life of <span class="person">Joneid Abú ’l-Kasem</span>, who was born and
educated in Baghdád, and died in the year of the Hejira 297 (A. D. 909),
one of the earliest and most celebrated founders of Súfism, we read what
follows: “Somebody said to Joneid: ‘I found that the Shaikhs of Khorasan
acknowledge three sorts of veils: the first is the nature (of man);
the second is the world, and the third concupiscence.’&mdash;‘These are,
said Joneid, ‘the veils which apply themselves to the heart of the common
among men; but there exists another sort of veil for special men;
that is, for the disciples of spiritual life, the Súfis: this is the view of
works, the consideration of the recompenses due to acts, and the regard
of the benefits of God. The Shaikh of Islamism said (relatively to this
subject): God is veiled from the heart of man, who sees his proper
actions; God is veiled even from him who seeks recompense, and from
him who, occupied with considering the benefit, turns his eyes from
the benefactor.’”&mdash;(See <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Notices et Extraits des MSS.</cite>, <abbr title="volume 12 page">vol. XII.;

founded upon a passage of the Koran (<abbr title="chapter 18 verses">chap. XVIII. vv.</abbr> 43, 44): “Let me
alone with him who accuseth this new revelation of imposture. We
will lead them gradually to destruction by ways which they know not;

positively prohibited by the Muhammedan religion, the first founders of
which, chiefs of warlike tribes, were by necessity, profession, and habit,
continually engaged in military expeditions. But to the Asiatic, in general,
so natural is ascetism, seclusion, and contemplation, that Muhammed, in
order to restrain a propensity which he felt and now and then showed
himself, declared that, for monachism, the pilgrimage to Mecca was substituted
by divine order. Even during the prophet’s life, the love of
monastic and anachoretic professions gained ascendancy among Muselmans,
and easily united with Súfism.</p>

<p class="p2 hanging"><span class="sc">Section <abbr title="Three">III</abbr>. Of some of the Saints among the
Moderns, and of the Sufis, whom the Author of
this Work has known.</span></p>

<p>The God-devoted lord Mawláná shah Badakhshí,
when he had come from his accustomed abode to
India, by the assistance of God was received among
the disciples of Shah Mír of the Kádarí lineage, who
had chosen his residence in the royal capital of Lahore,
and acquired great knowledge by his studies.
<a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pageno">285</span>
From the original compositions of this sect of holiness,
we have the following quatrain:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“The being who descended from his high sphere of sanctity,</div>
  <div class="i0">From the absolute world, inclined towards the nether bondage,</div>
  <div class="i0">He will, as long as the Lord forms mankind,</div>
  <div class="i0">Remain fitted to the four elements.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Besides, the lord Mahi eddin Muhammed, the
master of rank and dignity, the lord of the universe
Dáráshukó,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_252" id="fnanchor_252"></a><a href="#footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></span>
having, according to his desire, hastened
<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span class="pageno">286</span>
to wait on his person, obtained the object of his
wish, so that, whatever was established as certainty
among the theological propositions which he found
for the benefit of the travellers in the vast desert, he
sent it to Kachmír, where the lord Múláná sháh
keeps his residence.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Upon the whole, God spoke by the tongue of Omar.”</p>

<p>Any questions of every one who interrogates are
asked from <em>him</em>, although they may fall from the
tongue of the asker, and the hearing of every thing
solicited comes from the asker, although he himself
may not know it.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“All beings are one.”</p>

<p>Some of this sect of Alides (may God sanctify their
tombs!) also believe that the progress of perfection
has no limits, because revelation is without limit,
as it takes place every moment; hence it follows that
the increase cannot be limited. So they say, if the
Súfi live one thousand years, he still is in progress.
Some of the ancient Shaikhs proffer, as a confirmation
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pageno">287</span>
of this statement, that the Shaikh al islam,
“the shaikh of the right faith,” said: There exists
no more evident sign of bad fortune than the day of
a fixed fortune; whoever does not proceed, retrogrades.
It is reported as the saying of the prophet
(may the benediction of the most High be
upon him):</p>

<p class="blockquote">“He whose two days are alike is deceived.”</p>

<p>It was also said: “A traveller, who during two
days goes on in the same manner, is in the way of
detriment; he must be intent upon acquiring and
preserving.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_253" id="fnanchor_253"></a><a href="#footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>The greatest part of this sect maintain the same
doctrine, but, by the benediction of my Shaikh,
the crier for help in the quarters of heaven, the
teacher of the people of God, the godly, the lord
Mulána Shah (the peace and mercy of God be
his!), upon me, an humble person, fell, as if it
were the splendor of the sun, and made it clear to
me that the Súfi has degrees and a limit of perfection,
that, after having attained it, he remains at
that height; because with me, an humble broken
<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a><span class="pageno">288</span>
individual, to remain at a height attained, is proficiency,
inasmuch as every state has its perfection,
and the perfection of a progressing state annihilates
the progress. This is also the meaning of the before-quoted
saying of the prophet; because there is
bondage with those who tend towards God, and absolute
freedom with those only who are united with
him, and the words “two days” refer to time. In
the same manner my master (the mercy of God be
upon him!) interpreted those words. The truth is,
that they have not understood the saying, and have
not penetrated into the interior sense of the figurative
expression: because the latter refers in truth to
the insufficiency of a contemplative man: And this
sense agrees with that of the following authentic
tradition of the prophet (the peace and blessing of
the Highest be upon him):</p>

<p class="blockquote">“There are moments in which I am with God in such a manner that
neither angel nor arch-angel, nor prophet, nor apostle, can attain
to it.”</p>

<p>These words confirm his having once been in a
lower station. It is said that the prophet (the peace
and blessing of the most High be upon him!) was not
always of the same disposition, the same state, and
the same sort of constitution; but this is not so, but
from the same approved tradition it is evident that
the prophet (peace and blessing upon him!) was
always in the same state, and no ascent nor descent
<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><span class="pageno">289</span>
was possible therein because he says: “Yon place
was at once so contiguous to me, that no cherub
or no divine missioned prophet ever found
himself in such a situation.” The time of a
prophet is a universal one, and is free from temporariness:
this time has neither priority nor
posteriority<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“With thy Lord there is neither morning nor evening.”</p>

<p>Except this, the noble tradition has no meaning,
which is also evident from the obvious interpretation,
and moreover included in the state of perfection
and constitution of Muhammed (peace and blessing
upon him!). But, in the sense which they
attribute to the words, a deficiency is necessarily
implied. The state of the lord of the world (Muhammed)
is always in the perfection of unity; this
is the best to adopt, at times in a particular, and at
times in a general qualification. There is also another
interpretation which the Shaikhs (the mercy
of the most High be upon them) gave to these words:
inasmuch as the gradations of these Saints are infinite.
Thus in the work <cite>nefhát ul ins</cite>, “the fragrant
gales of mankind,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_254" id="fnanchor_254"></a><a href="#footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></span>
the opinion of the Shaikhs is
stated to be, that some of the saints are without a
mark and without an attribute, and the perfection
of a state, and the utmost degree to which Saints
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pageno">290</span>
may attain, is to be without an attribute and without
a mark. It was said:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“He who has no mark, his mark are we.”</p>

<p>Besides, those who acknowledge an ascent without
a limit, if in the pure being and true essence of
the glorious and most high God, who is exempt and
free from ascent and descent, color, odor, outwardness
and inwardness, increase and decrease, they
admit a progression, it must also be admissible in
the existence of a Súfi professing the unity of God.
And if they do not admit a gradation of progress
<em>in God</em>, then they ought not to admit it in the professor
of the divine unity, who in the exalted state
of purity and holiness became united with him.
When a devotee among men, having left the connexion
with works of supererogation, arrives at that
of divine precepts, he realises the words:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“When thou didst cast thy arrows against them, thou didst not cast
them, but God slew them.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_255" id="fnanchor_255"></a><a href="#footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be said: Certainly, he who became one
with God, and of whose being not an atom remained,
<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pageno">291</span>
he, from whose sight both worlds vanished, who in
the steps of right faith arrived at the rank of perfect
purity, and from truth to truth became God, what
then higher than God can there ever be, to which
the pious professor of unity may further tend to
ascend? It is known:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Beyond blackness, no color can go.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_256" id="fnanchor_256"></a><a href="#footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Every one, as long as he is in the state of progress,
cannot have arrived at the condition</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Where there is no fear and no care.”</p>

<p class="unindent"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><span class="pageno">292</span>
Because care and fear derive from ascent and descent.
Fear at ascending is in the expectation whether
the ascent will succeed or not, but whoever disregards
ascent and descent, and elevates himself
above care and fear, he obtains tranquillity in tranquillity,
and rectitude in rectitude. And the verse
of the merciful is:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Keep thyself upright as thou wast directed.”</p>

<p>Hence is also understood, that the Súfi remains
steadfast in the dignity of perfection, for rectitude
is perseverance. O Muhammed! it is necessary;
remain fixed in the dignity of professing the unity
of God, which is free from the misfortune of inconstancy.
And the verse of the merciful is:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The day on which I perfected religion for your sake, and rendered
complete my favor towards you.”</p>

<p>This indicates clearly the meaning that, by this
perfection also, the prophet (upon whom be the
peace and the blessing of the most High!) is manifested.
And those who, on account of the infinity
of revelation, hold progress to be perpetual, are not
right: because, as long as the sight is illuminated
by the light of the revelation, the revelationists and
the illuminated are still separate, and not yet become
one:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_257" id="fnanchor_257"></a><a href="#footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></span>
in this state there is duality and infidelity
<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a><span class="pageno">293</span>
in the individual who has not yet been liberated
from the idea of something double in himself, and
he to whom an atom of something else but that one
remains attached is reckoned, by all professors of
unity and by all perfect saints, to be one who gives
partners to God or an infidel, and in a state of deficiency.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“It behoves thee to keep neither soul nor body,</div>
  <div class="i0">And if they both remain, I do not remain;</div>

  <div class="i0">Know, by this one hair, thy foot remains fettered.</div>
  <div class="i0">As long as thou playest not at once thy life,</div>
  <div class="i0">I shall consider thee as polluted and impious.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="blockquote unindent">* Why dost thou not thyself produce revelation, so that thou mayest
always be illuminated? *<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_258" id="fnanchor_258"></a><a href="#footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></span>

<p><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a><span class="pageno">294</span>
As this question, solved in this manner by me,
humble individual, was very abstruse, I sent it to
my friends, that, if there were occasion for <em>further</em>
discussion, they might write to me, and thus the
matter be better elucidated. God alone is all-sufficient;
the rest is inordinate desire. What has been
hitherto said is taken from the prince of the world
(Dara sheko).</p>

<p>It should be known that, in the work <cite>Merás ed al
ânáyet</cite>, “Observations upon the blessed favor,” is
stated, that the sect, which in their (exalted) feeling<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_259" id="fnanchor_259"></a><a href="#footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></span>
conquer the state of <dfn>jazbet</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_260" id="fnanchor_260"></a><a href="#footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></span>
<dfn>jamâ va vahedet</dfn>,
“attraction, union, and unity,” have acquired, by
means of the superiority of the manifest name (<em>the
quality of</em>) exterior deity, and interior and hidden
creation. This sect is called, in the language of
the Súfis, <dfn>saheban-i-kereb</dfn><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_261" id="fnanchor_261"></a><a href="#footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></span>
<dfn>-i-feráis</dfn>, “the masters of
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span class="pageno">295</span>
proximity to divine “precepts,” and this proximity
is acknowledged to be that of divine precepts. This
sect, which, on account of the proper meaning of
the name of <dfn>al báten</dfn>, “interior,” may be brought
into relation with expansive creation and hidden
reality, this sect after <dfn>jamâ</dfn>, “union,” obtains <dfn>ferk</dfn>,
“division,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_262" id="fnanchor_262"></a><a href="#footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></span>
and this is called <dfn>kereb-i-naváfil</dfn>, “proximity
of supererogation.” The lord Shaikh Muhammed
Láheji states that <dfn>jamâ</dfn>, “union,” is contrary
to <dfn>ferk</dfn>, “division;” and division is the veil of
God before the creatures. Every one sees the creation,
but acknowledges God to be without it; every
one has the sight of God by means of the creation,
that is, every one sees God, but the creation by
itself affords no access to the sight of him.</p>

<p><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a><span class="pageno">296</span>
Besides, the Mariyam of the world, the Fátima of
the time and ages, the purity of human kind, the
protecting intelligence, <dfn>Jehán ára</dfn> “the ornament of
the world,” the <dfn>begum</dfn>, the lady, the daughter
of <span class="person">Abu ’l Muzafer Shíhábu ’d dín Muhammed sáhib-Kirán
sání Amir ul muslemin sháh Jehán pádsháh ghází</span>,
“the victorious lord, the bright star of religion,
Muhammed, a second Sáhib Kírán, the Amir of
the believers,” Shah Jehan, the conquering emperor,
having secretly followed, by the desire of her
heart, the injunctions of the blessed Mullá shah,
turned her face to the right rule, and attained her
wish, the full knowledge of God. One of the wonderful
speeches of this blessed and exalted personage,
whom the author of this book knew, is the following:
In the year of the Hejira 1057 (A. D.
1647) Mulla shah came to the house of a friend in
Hyderábád. One of the persons present, by way of
reproving allusion, began to ask questions about the
hurt which the begum of the lord received by fire.
The teacher of morality said to him: “A slight garment
imbibed with oil, when it takes fire, is
easily burnt;” in such a manner came the misfortune
upon the most pure form of her majesty. This
person laughed and continued to revile. By accident,
somebody came from the house of this person
and said: “What, art thou sitting here, whilst thy
sister is burnt, because fire fell upon her garment.”
<a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a><span class="pageno">297</span>
The master observed: “In such a manner,
I said, befell misfortune on the illustrious
princess; God has shown it to thee.”</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“The lamp which God has lighted,</div>
  <div class="i0">Whoever blows it out burns his beard.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The Sufi Mulla Ismâíl Isfahaní, seeking enjoyment,
came from Iran to the great towns of India,
and in Lahore visited the lord Mián Mír; he chose
the condition of a Durvish, and from Lahore soon
betook himself to Kashmir, where he abandoned the
worldly affairs, and practised pious austerity. The
author of this book saw him in Kashmir, in the year
of the Hejira 1049 (A. D. 1639). The following
verse is by him:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“I knocked down every idol which was in my way,</div>
  <div class="i0">No other idol remains to my veneration but God himself.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>From Mírzá Muhammed Makím, the jeweller,
the information was received that Mír Fakher eddin
Muhammed Tafresí was occupied in Kashmir with
reviling and reproving Mulla Ismâíl and Fakher, and
said: “These belong to the infidels, and are destined
to hell.” Mulla Ismâíl answered: “In this
state I withheld my hand from worldly affairs,
and in this world never was associated to thee;
in like manner in the future world, as, according
to thy opinion, we are infidels, and go to hell, and
not to heaven with thee; therefore it behoves thee
to be satisfied and content with us, as we have left
<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span class="pageno">298</span>
to thee the present and the future world.” The
Mobed says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i2">“The pious and the idolaters are satisfied with us, as we</div>
  <div class="i0">Are not ourselves their partners, neither in this nor in the other world;</div>
  <div class="i0">Enmity arises from partnership; we, with the intention of friendship,</div>
  <div class="i2">Gave up the future, and follow the present world.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Mírzá Muhammed Mokim, the jeweller, further
said: A person gave bad names to Fakheraye Fál;
the latter, looking towards him, gave him no
answer. When we asked him the reason of his
silence, he replied: “A man moved his lips, and
agitated the air; what does that concern me?”
Fakher, the ornament of mankind, was not much
addicted to religious austerity, but gave himself up
to counselling, reforming, and correcting others.
He assumed the surname of <dfn>Tarsa</dfn>, “timid, or unbeliever;”
he called the Journal of his travels,
<cite>Dair-namah</cite>, “Journal of a tavern (also monastery).”
In this Journal are the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“I met upon my road with a bitch,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like a dog guided by scent in the circle of a chase.</div>
  <div class="i0">Her paw was colored with blood,</div>
  <div class="i0">In the middle of the road she lay like a tiger;</div>
  <div class="i0">Impelled either by wild instinct or necessity,</div>
  <div class="i0">She had made her own whelp the aliment of life.</div>
  <div class="i0">At the sight of so strange a scene,</div>
  <div class="i0">I restrained my hand from striking, and opening my lips,</div>
  <div class="i0">I said: ‘O dog, what desirest thou to do?</div>
  <div class="i0">Upon thy own heart why inflicting all this pain?’</div>
  <div class="i0">Scarce had the tip of my tongue perforated the pearl of the secret,</div>
  <div class="i0">When her tail was agitated, and she said:</div>

                 ‘O thou who art not informed of thy own state,</div>
  <div class="i0">How shall I give thee an account of my condition?’</div>
  <div class="i0">When the words of the dog came upon my ear,</div>
  <div class="i0">A resplendent sun fell into my mind.</div>
  <div class="i0">In the sense of (<em>these words indicative of the dog’s</em>) insanity,</div>
  <div class="i0">My own sense found the authority of a precept.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_263" id="fnanchor_263"></a><a href="#footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></span></div>
  <div class="i0">The desire of wandering in the garden left my heart,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which assumed the quality of a tulip and a deep mark;</div>
  <div class="i0">It saw nothing upon the path of profligacy</div>
  <div class="i0">But the privation of remedies.</div>
  <div class="i0">I said again to her: ‘O lion-like dog,</div>
  <div class="i0">The morning-breeze learns from thee rapidity:</div>
  <div class="i0">Manifest to me the state of thy heart,</div>
  <div class="i0">Exhibit to me the form of its history.’</div>
  <div class="i0">She gave a howl, and, emitting lamentations:</div>
  <div class="i0">Rendered testimony of her own secret condition:</div>
  <div class="i0a">‘I devoured the blood of the offspring of my own womb</div>
  <div class="i0">That nobody might place a weight upon my head.’”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>In the year of the Hejira 1056 (A. D. 1647),
according to information received, Fakhera Tarsa
left his old habitation in Ahmed ábad of Guzerat.
The father of the Durvish, the pious Sabjáni, was
an inhabitant of Hirát, but he was born in India.
This illustrious person made a great proficiency
in the sciences of philosophy and history, and acquired
also a fortune but he at last turned his
face from it, and chose retirement and solitude; for
<a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><span class="pageno">300</span>
many years he followed the footsteps of a perfect
spiritual guide; he travelled to see monasteries and
hermitages, until he became the disciple of Shaikh
Mujed eddín Muhammed Balkhí Kâderí, who was
free, virtuous, and remote from the world. The
said Shaikh read the whole work of Shaikh Mohí
eddín Arabi before his master, and his master
perused it likewise with Shaikh Sader eddin. Kautíví,
who had heard the whole of it from Shaidh Mohí
eddín. Ths pious Sabjání frequently expounded
the words of the lord Rais ul Mohedín, “the chief
of the believers of divine unity,” Shaikh Mohí
eddín Arabí, and those of the best Súfis, and as
he was carried to the very limit of evidence, he
found them conformable with the doctrine of the
Platonists. The godly Sabjána studied the whole
work of the celebrated Shaikh in the service of his
perfect master. After this attendance, having resigned
every thing into the hands of the fortunate
Shaikh, he turned his face entirely to sanctity,
and lived a considerable time retired in solitude,
until his master declared to him: Now, thou hast
attained perfection. The pious Sabjáni keeps nothing
with him but the cover of his privities, he
abstains from eating the flesh of any animal; he
asks for nothing; if any sustenance be left near
him, provided it be not animal food, he takes a
little of it; he venerates the mosques and the
<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a><span class="pageno">301</span>
temples of idols; and he performs in <dfn>butgadah</dfn>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_264" id="fnanchor_264"></a><a href="#footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></span>
“house of idols,” according to the usage of
the Hindus, the <dfn>puja</dfn> and <dfn>dandavet</dfn>, “worship and
prostration,” that is, the religious rites, but in
the mosques he conforms in praying after the manner
of the Muselmans; he never abuses the faith
and rites of others; nor gives he one creed preference
over another; he always practises abstinence,
but at times he breaks the fast with some
fruits from the mountains, such as pine-kernels, and
the like; he takes no pleasure in demonstrations of
honor and magnificence to him, nor is he afflicted
by disdain and contempt, and in order to remain
unknown to men, he dwells in the <dfn>Kohistan</dfn>, “mountainous
country” of the Afgháns and Kafrís, and
the like. The Kafrís are a tribe from Kabulistan,
and are called Kafer <span class="title">Katóriz</span>, who before lived upon
mountains, in deserts and forests, remote and concealed
from others.</p>

<p>The author of this book saw Sabjání in the year
of the Hejira 1046 (A. D. 1636) in upper Bangash.
This personage never sleeps at night, but sits awake
in deep meditation; every one who sees him would
take him for a divine being. Shaikh Sâdi says:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a><span class="pageno">302</span>
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“Dost thou not know that, when I went to the friend,</div>
  <div class="i0">As soon as I arrived before him, I said: ‘It is he.’”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_265" id="fnanchor_265"></a><a href="#footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></span></div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Sabjání appears a (divine) revelation in his actions,
steps, attributes, and nature, and to have
attained the summit of perfection. He said that,
with respect to the other world, there are several
classes of men. The one denies the absolute being;
another interprets it in an abstract manner of reasoning,
inasmuch as they have sufficient intelligence
to be modest and conciliating. The distinguished
Súfis, without interpreting the different systems of
nations, which, in their separate creeds of various
kinds and religions, differ about the beforesaid object,
view in the bodies the agreeableness of imagery.
Khiźer, Elías, Brahma, Ganésa, and all the gods
of India, these and the like representations, which
in this world have no reality, all are distinct objects
of imagination. Essential is what was said by Abu
Nazer Farábí (may God illume his grave!) that the
common people view their creeds under the form of
their imagination. The author of this book heard
also from the lord, the pious Sábjaní: The contemplative
man sees every one whom he loves and
esteems, frequently in dreams in a beautiful shape,
and in an exalted state, although to other people he
may appear iniquitous; and the person whom he
<a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a><span class="pageno">303</span>
knows to be depraved, will often be viewed by him
in a repulsive condition, although to the crowd he
may appear glorious and powerful. Hence follows,
that the learned among the contemplative
persons make use of a negative argument in their
creed, in order that it may become evident what the
truth really is. When any one sees a person of
high rank, such as a prophet, an Imám, or any dignified
individual, in a state of some deficiency, he
views his own defects in his understanding, spirit,
heart, or nature; and as these things are but seeming
defects in the great personage, he must endeavor
to remove them from himself. In like manner,
if one sees a person in good health (appearing
to him) in a state of illness, there is illness in his
own state, and if he thinks him bad with regard to
his own faith, he ought to be somewhat disposed to
think that person good.</p>

<p>A disciple demanded some employment from Sabjání.
The master asked him: “Hast thou devoted
thyself to piety?” The answer was: “I have.”
Then Sabjání said: “If thou art a Muselman, go to
the Franks, and stay with that people; if thou
art a Nazarean, join the Jews; if a Sonni, betake
thyself to Irak, and hear the speeches and reproaches
of those men; if thou professest to
be a Shíah, mix with the schismatics, and lend
thy ear to their words; in this manner, whatever
<a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a><span class="pageno">304</span>
be thy religion, associate with men of an
opposite persuasion; if, in hearing their discourses
thou feelest but little disturbed, thy mind
keeps the tenor of piety; but if thou art not in
the least moved and mixest with them like milk
and sugar, then certainly thou hast attained the
highest degree of perfect peace, and art a master
of the divine creation.”</p>

<p>Yusef was a man belonging to the tribe of Durds,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_266" id="fnanchor_266"></a><a href="#footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></span>
and in his youth a hermit; at last, by his efforts, he
found access to the intellectual world, and by the
grace of God he carried it so far, that he was ranged
among the disciples called Sanyásis, on account of
their piety and knowledge, and among the learned
followers of the celebrated master, who dwelt in
Bárahmúlah, a village in Kachmir. It so happened
that, when he devoted himself to his service, he
found what he was in search of. Shaikh At´ar
says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0b">“An unbeliever becomes a relation by love;</div>
  <div class="i0">A lover acquires the high sense of a durvish.”</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Having known many countries and persons, he
became impressed with the marks of revelations.
So it happened that the author of this book heard
from him what follows: “One night I saw in a
<a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><span class="pageno">305</span>
dream that the world was deluged by water; there
remained no trace of a living being, and I was
myself immersed in the water. In the midst of
this state I saw a kingly rider come, sitting upon
his horse upon the surface of the water. When he
came near me, he said to me: ‘Come with me
that I may save thee.’ I replied: ‘Who art
thou?’ He answered: ‘I am the self-existing
being, and creator of all things.’ Then I began
to follow him rapidly, and run along the surface
of the water, until I arrived in a garden. There
I put my foot on the ground, and, directing my
sight to the right, I beheld a delightful spot, full
of all sorts of odoriferous herbs and elevated
palaces, huris (beautiful virgins), kaśurs (bridal
chambers), and youths and boys, and all the gifts
of heaven, as well as the blessed, occupied with
enjoyments. Besides, at the left, I saw pits,
black, narrow, and tenebrious; and therein, like
bats, suspended a crowd of miserable beings
whose hands and feet were tied to the neck. The
horseman, after having invited me to a pleasure-walk
in the garden, wanted to conduct me out of
the delightful place, but I had resolved in myself
that, like Idris, I would not go out of it. Then I
stuck close to the door, and took fast hold of the
post. When I awoke from sleep, I found my
lips held fast by both my hands; and thus it was
<a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a><span class="pageno">306</span>
revealed to me that, whatever is, exists within
mankind itself.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Demand from thyself whatever thou wishest: for thou art every
thing.”</p>

<p>It is related: That there was a man called <span class="person">Baháder</span>
among the Hindus, and he happened to have no male
offspring in his house; therefore he came to Baba
Yúsef, and demanded his benediction. Baba Yúsef
gave him a bit of white earth, and said to him:
“Let thy wife eat it.” When the man had done as
was enjoined him, a boy was born in his house, and
received the name of <span class="person">Rahu</span>. This individual, by the
favor of the friends of God, became a learned man,
and acquired the surname of “independent,” as was
said in the chapter of the Jnanian.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_267" id="fnanchor_267"></a><a href="#footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mulla, called Umer, prohibited Baba Yúsef to
listen to music, and whatever gentle entreaties Baba
Yúsef employed, he paid no attention to them; at
last the Baba, in the perturbation of his mind, threw
a small fragment of stone upon him, in such a manner
that Mulla Umer lost his senses for some time;
when he recovered, he prostrated himself before the
Baba, went out, and was no more seen.</p>

<p>Yúsef, the inspired, was a durvish, devoted to the
practice of restraining his breath, which he carried
so far that he kept his breath during four watches
<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><span class="pageno">307</span>
(twelve hours).<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_268" id="fnanchor_268"></a><a href="#footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></span>
One of his friends said to the
author of this book in Kachmir, that Yúsef during a
length of time ate nothing at all. The friend related:
“I went one night to watch with him; he said
to me: ‘Go and eat something.’ I replied: ‘I
will; but it would be well that thou also shouldst
take something to eat and to drink.’ His answer
was: ‘Thou art not able to satisfy my want
of food.’ I assured him: ‘I am able.’ He
then ordered: ‘Go, bring what thou hast.’ I
went home and brought him a great dish full of
rice, a large cup of coagulated milk, with bread
and other eatables, as much as might have been
sufficient for ten gluttons; he eat up every thing,
and said: ‘Bring something more.’ I went
home, prepared a meal for twenty persons, and
with the aid of the people of the house, brought
it to him. He eat it up, and desired more. I
returned home, and carried to him meats half
cooked and other things. He eat up all, and said:
‘Bring more.’ I fell at his feet; he called out:
‘Have I not said to thee that thou wouldst not be
able to satisfy my want of food.’”</p>

<p>One of his disciples related: Yúsef said, that he
<a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a><span class="pageno">308</span>
has seen God the Almighty in the shape of a man,
sitting in his house. The author of this book frequented
the society of many contemplative pious
Súfis, and learned men of this sect, elevated in rank;
if he should relate all he knows of them, he would
have to write a copious work.</p>

<p>To sum up precisely the creed of all these sects, it
may be said, that some do not agree upon beings
perceived and beings probable, but all acknowledge
the existence of appearances. These are called
<span class="title">Súfistáyah</span>, and in Persian <span class="title">Samrádí</span>. All those who
believe all ought to be comprehended in what is
perceived, and deny any reality to things probable
(or to the subjects of reason), are named <span class="title">Tábíâyah</span>,
“physiologists,” in Persian, <span class="trans">Mansí</span>. The belief of
the latter is, that the world is composed of things
perceived, and of individuals, children of Adam, and
that animals are like plants: the one dries, the
other shoots up afresh, and this occurrence will be
repeated without end. Enjoyment is comprehended
in eating, drinking, women, vehicles, and the like,
and besides this world there is no other existence.
Some agree upon the existence of things perceived
and things probable, but differ upon the limits and
laws. These are entitled <span class="title">Filásafa-i-dahriah</span>, “secular
philosophers,” in Persian <span class="title">Jáyákárí</span>, “attached
to temporariness.” This sect establishes a world
of probabilities (composed) of nothing but things
<a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a><span class="pageno">309</span>
perceived, but they believe also the perfection proper
to mankind is that, after a certain knowledge of an
Almighty Creator, they attain the future spiritual
existence in an exalted station of the rational world,
and become blessed with an abundance of every
beatitude; they acknowledge a powerful intrinsic
virtue of the intellect in the acquisition of this everlasting
beatitude, which, with the essence of wisdom,
has no want of another gift of any sort whatever.
Disgrace means the opposition to the mode
of laudable reason, and law is the mode in which
the wise have settled the common affairs of the
individuals of mankind conformably with rectitude.</p>

<p>There is another sect which, assuming the conviction
of a material and immaterial world, and the
power of reason, believe in a prophet, and say, that
these distinguished persons have established the law
for the good of God’s creatures and the order of
cities; and to that effect they possess a knowledge
of the highest and most perfect kind; they are supported
by the self-existing Being for the establishment
of regulations and the decision of what is
legal and forbidden, and what they announce concerning
the world of spirits, angels, the ninth heaven,
the throne of God, the tables of destiny, the
written characters, and the like, are all ingenious
inventions, rendered sensible to the understanding
of the vulgar under forms which strike the imagination
<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><span class="pageno">310</span>
and offer tangible bodies; in this manner, in the
account of the other world, they represent figuratively
paradise, and húrís, kasúrs, rivers, birds,
and fruits, merely with the intention of subduing
the hearts of the vulgar, as allurement often renders
their minds inclined to the proposed ends.
And what they relate of chains, bolts, and hell, is
calculated for alarming and terrifying the people.
This class of men, that is the philosophers, direct
also their hints and interpretation to this object, and
their disciples say, that their wish is to follow the
indicated footsteps of the prophet; these are the
pious sages to whom they give the title of “philosophers
of God,” and in Persian, <span class="title">Jánsáyi</span>, “the polishers
of souls.”</p>

<p>The sect which adopts the material and immaterial
world, adopts also the precepts of reason, but
not the laws of the prophet. These are named <span class="title">Sábíah</span>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_269" id="fnanchor_269"></a><a href="#footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></span>
Another sect agrees to the material and immaterial
<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a><span class="pageno">311</span>
world, and to the precepts of religious
reason, but they say that the law of the prophet is
<a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><span class="pageno">312</span>
to be conformable with reason, and every prophet
who appears is not to be opposed to his predecessor,
and not self-complacently to exalt his law: these are
the <i>Yézdanían</i>. Some adopt the law of tradition,
which others, with respect to literal meaning, reject
as contrary to reason.</p>

<p>It is known that there are five great religions,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: that of the Hindus, Jews, Magians, Nazárean,
and Muselmans. Each of these five proffer claims
that their law is the true one, and set forth demonstrations
for the confirmation of its truth.</p>

<p>Finally, at the conclusion of this book let it be
said that, according to the statement of some excellent
personages, every thing relating to religion and
law has been exhibited in the work <cite>Tabśeret ul âvam</cite>,
“Rendering the Vulgar quick-sighted;” but at
<a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a><span class="pageno">313</span>
present this is not before the eyes of the author; on
that account its contents remain unknown to him.
The author begs further to say that, after having
greatly frequented the meetings of the followers of
the five beforesaid religions, he wished and undertook
to write this book, and whatever in this work
treating of the religions of countries has been stated,
concerning the creed of different sects, had been
received from the tongue of the chiefs of those sects
or from their books, and, as to the account of the
persons belonging to any particular sect, the author
wrote down the information which had been imparted
to him by their adherents and sincere friends,
in such a manner that no trace of partiality nor aversion
might be perceived; in short, the writer of these
pages performed nothing more than the office of a
translator.</p>

<p>Thus, by the aid of the generous King, was brought
to a conclusion the printing of this work, entitled
<cite>Dabistán al Mazáheb</cite>, “the school of sects,” in the
month of October of the year 1809, since the Messiah’s

penultimate month of the Muhammedans,” of the
year 1224 of the Hejira of Muhammed, upon whom
be the most excellent blessings and veneration, as
well as upon his family and companions. Glory to
God for his benefits! at the final conclusion.</p>

 Darashiko was the eldest son and heir presumptive of <span class="person">Shah-Jehan</span>,
of Delhi, during whose life he defended him against the rebellion of his
younger brother, <span class="person">Aureng-zeb</span>, who, leagued with two other brothers,
attempted to dethrone his father. Dara, having been defeated in a
battle on the river Jambul, retired towards Lahore, whilst the victorious
Aureng-zeb proceeded to Agra, and by stratagem rendered himself master
of his father’s person, and imprisoned his brother Murad bakhsh, whom
he had, till then, treated as emperor, in the castle of Agra, where the captive
prince died. Proclaimed emperor under the title of <span class="title">Aalemgir</span>, the
new sovereign now turned his arms against Dara, who was in possession
of the <span class="place">Panj-ab</span>, <span class="place">Multan</span>, and <span class="place">Kabul</span>, and defended the line of the <span class="place">Setlej</span>.
Here beaten, Dara retired beyond the Indus, and took refuge in the mountains
of Bikker. Aalumgir was called to <span class="place">Allahabad</span>, to encounter his
brother <span class="person">Suja</span>, who had moved from Bengal to assert his right to the
throne. Aalemgir had scarce repulsed him, when he was obliged to
haste towards Guzerat: there was Dara, who had recrossed the Indus
and taken an advantageous position in that maritime province. He
might have been victorious in a battle, but he succumbed to the artfulness
of Aalemgir. Deserted by his army, abandoned by his allies, he was
delivered up by traitors to his cruel brother, subjected to an ignominious
exposition in the streets of Delhi, and executed. Suja, Alemgir’s
last brother was obliged to fly to Arrakan, where he died, seven years
before his father, Shah Jehan, who died his son’s prisoner, in 1665. I have
related the principal events of one single year, 1658 of our era. This
is a date in the life of the author of the Dabistán, then in his fortieth
year or thereabout. He was before this time in the Panjab, and might have
personally known Darashuko, who was renowned for his great learning
and most religious turn of mind. Besides what is said above in our text,
we know (see <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires sur les particularités de la Religion musulmane</cite>,
par M. Garcin de Tassy, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 107), that Dara frequented <span class="person">Baba Lal</span>, a
Hindu Durvish, who inhabited Dhianpur in the province of Lahore, and
conversed with him upon religious matters. The Munshi <span class="person">Shanderban
Shah Jehani</span> wrote a Persian work, which contains the pious conversations
of these personages.</p>

 These are evidently sentiments conducive to progressive civilization
and perfection of mankind, and prove that, in Asia, even under the domination
of the Muhammedan religion, men felt that they are not doomed
to be <em>stationary</em>; thus the absurd dogma of fatality was, by a fortunate
inconsistency, counterbalanced by the dictates of sound reason. Unfortunately,
our author, generally so liberal-minded, appears upon that
point not to range himself upon the most rational side.</p>

victory gained at Bedr over a superior force of the Koreish. The
prophet, by the direction of the angel Gabriel, took a handful of gravel,
and threw it towards the enemy, saying: “May their faces be confounded:”
whereupon they immediately turned their backs and fled. Hence the
above passage is also rendered: “Neither didst thou, O <em>Muhammed!</em>
cast <em>the gravel into their eyes</em>, when thou didst <em>seem to</em> cast <em>it</em>, but God
cast <em>it</em>.”</p>

 The assumption of being God was not uncommon among the Súfis.
One of the most distinguished was <span class="person">Hassain Manśur Hallaj</span>, a disciple of
Joneid. After having taught the most exalted mysticism, in several
countries, Hallaj was condemned to death in Baghdad, according to Ben
Shohnah on account of a point of his doctrine concerning the pilgrimage
to Mecca, for which he thought some other good works might be justly
substituted, according to Sheheristáni and others, on account of having
proclaimed himself to be God. During the infliction of one thousand
stripes, followed by a gradual dismemberment of his whole body, he never
ceased, by words and acts, to give demonstrations of the most extatic joy.
The manner of his death is variously related.&mdash;(See Herbelot, and <cite>Taskirat
al aulia</cite>, by Farid-eddin in Tholuck’s <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Blüthen sammlung aus morgenländischer
Mystik</cite>, S. 311-327). Abu Yezid Bastami (before mentioned,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 229, <a href="#footnote_181">note</a>) also used to salute himself as God. “Agriculturists,” says
Ghazali, “left their fields and assumed such a character; nature is
delighted with speeches which permit works to be neglected, under the
illusion of purifying the heart by the attainment of certain degrees
and qualities.” This opinion produced great evils, “so that,” adds
the said author in his indignation, “to put to death the lowest of those
who set forth such futile pretensions, is more consistent with God’s
religion than to preserve the life of ten persons.” &mdash;(See Pocock, first
<abbr title="edition, pages">edit., pp.</abbr> 268-269.)</p>

 As long as the Sufi is conscious of the least distinction between God
and himself, he is not thoroughly penetrated by the unity of God. Here
follows the translation of a passage taken from the Masnavi of the celebrated
Jelal eddin Rumi, which passage, we may agree with Silvestre de
Sacy, admirably expresses this mystic doctrine in the form of an apologue:
“A man knocked at the door of his friend. The latter asked:
‘Who art thou, my dear?’&mdash;‘It is I.’&mdash;‘In this case, be off; I cannot
at present receive thee; there is no place at my board for one who is
still <em>raw</em>; such a man cannot be sufficiently <em>dressed</em> (that is matured)
and cured of hypocrisy, but by the fire of separation and
refusal.’ The unfortunate man departed. He employed a whole
year in travelling, consuming himself in the flames of desire and affliction,
caused by the absence of his friend. Matured and perfected by
his long trial, he again approached the door of his friend and knocked
modestly, fearful that an uncivil word might again fall from his own
lips.&mdash;‘Who is there?’ was asked from the interior of the house.’&mdash;‘Dear
friend, it is thyself who art at the door.’&mdash;‘Because it is myself,
enter to-day; this house can contain no other than I.’”&mdash;(See <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Notices

 <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">جذبه</span>, “attraction,” is a mystical state, in which God attracts the
saint, in order that he, an obedient servant, may direct his mind towards
the side to which he is attracted, and may be inflamed in such a manner
as to rise up towards heaven. The <i>majezub</i>, “attracted,” form a
particular class of the Súfis.&mdash;(See <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 250-251, note <a href="#footnote_211">1</a>.)</p>

 <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">جمع</span> and <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">فرق</span> are terms used in a particular sense by the Sufis.
In the state of jamá, “union,” the mystic sees but God and his unity;
in the state of <dfn>ferk</dfn>, “division,” man enters again into the natural state,
and occupies himself with good works and the fulfilment of precepts.
He does even what is not prescribed conformably with this passage of the
Koran (<abbr title="chapter Seventeen verse">chap. XVII. v.</abbr> 81): “Watch some part of the night in the same
exercise (praying), as a work of supererogation for thee; peradventure
thy Lord will raise thee to an honorable station.” These two states
(union and division) are necessary to the mystic. The following passage
of the Koran is quoted as an authority for this doctrine: <cite>God testifies that
there is no God but him</cite>; this is “union;” <cite>and the angels testify the
same, as well as the men who possess the science</cite>; this is “division.”</p>

 Sheheristáni derives the name <span lang="fa" xml:lang="fa">صابيا</span> <dfn>sábía</dfn> from the Syriac verb
<dfn>sábá</dfn>, “to love, to desire.” It has also been deduced from <dfn>saba</dfn>, “a host,”
(meaning the stars); commonly it means “an apostate from another
religion;” so was called Muhammed for having abandoned this very
Sábéan religion, before him dominant in Arabia, to which religion, however,
he granted protection in his Koran, associating it there with Judaism
and Christianism. According to Maimonides (who died A. D. 1208),
this religion was very ancient, and once pervaded nearly the whole world.
It is said to have been founded by <span class="person">Seth</span>, Adam’s son (who is also called
the <span class="title">Egyptian Agathodémon</span>, master of <span class="title">Hermes</span>), whose son was <span class="person">Sábí</span>. It
was propagated by Enoch (also Hermes). The most ancient books of this
creed are reported to be written in the language which Adam and his
sons spoke: the Arabians still show a book of Seth. The original
religion of the Sabaians consisted in the veneration of the stars and of
angels, and coincided in its principal notions with the ancient system of
the Persians, as described in vol. I. Pursuant to Sheheristáni, the Sabaians
were worshippers of <em>chapels</em> and of <em>images</em>. The bodies of the
seven planets they called <dfn>chapels</dfn>; these they held to be inhabited by
intelligences, by which they were animated in the same manner as our
bodies are by souls. They observed the rising, setting, and motion of the
stars, for the division of time, and, mixing superstitious notions and rites
with their observations, made seals and talismans, and used incantations
and particular prayers; they not only built chapels of different figures,
but also formed images of different metals appropriated to each of the
planets; by the mediation of the images they had access to the chapels;
by means of the chapels to the intelligences or lords; and by aid of
these to the supreme God, the Lord of lords. In this manner they held
the planets to be inferior deities, mediators between man and the supreme
God. According to the before-mentioned Maimonides, they acknowledged
no deities except the stars, among which the sun was the greatest.
Abul faraj says that they firmly believed the unity of God.</p>

<p class="footnote">Among the sects of this religion is that of the <span class="title">Harbanists</span>, or <span class="title">Harnanites</span>:
these believe one God manifesting himself in different bodies, heavenly
and terrestrial, his creatures; he committed the government of the
inferior world to the first: these are the fathers, the elements the mothers,
and the compound beings the children of both. After the period of
36,425 years, the universe perishes; nature is then renewed by a couple
of each species of beings; thus centuries succeed each other, and there is
not any other <em>resurrection</em>.</p>

<p class="footnote">Sabaism must be distinguished as <em>ancient</em> and <em>modern</em>. The first,
especially if so remote as it is said to be, can but have imparted, and
the other owe, more than one notion, dogma, and rite to Judaism,
Christianism, and Muhammedism, all which may be considered as divisions
of one and the same Asiatic religion. Thus, in all the four religions,
the same patriarchs and the same books, such as the Psalter, are
venerated; the Sabaians have a sort of baptism, as the Christians; they
believe that angels and intelligences, these movers of the universe, perform
the same office which the Muhammedans ascribe to the patriarchs
and prophets, they venerate with the latter the temple of Mecca; they
perform, however, their principal pilgrimage to a place near Harran (the
ancient Carræ) in Mesopotamia; they honor also the pyramids of Egypt,
and say, that <span class="person">Sábí</span>, son of Seth or Enoch, is buried in the third. They
turn their face in praying towards the arctic pole.</p>

<p class="footnote">Several Oriental authors have treated of this religion. To those mentioned
in this note, I shall only add <span class="person">Abulfeda</span> and <span class="person">Mohib eddin Abu ’l

 The Muhammedans do not believe that the crucifixion of Jesus Christ

<p>The meanest of the weak servants in the post of
ignorance, taking upon himself to offer a noble present
to the lordship of the country of God’s creatures
in the empire of positive truths, and of the
throne-ornaments belonging to the district of subtilties,
represents, that the power of the omniscient
and bountiful God (be his majesty displayed and his
mercy diffused upon all!), has gratified the species
of mankind, according to the exigency of natural
genius, and the propensity of mind; and according
to the choice of a special rule and the assumption of
a particular religious opinion <em>of each</em>, in such a manner
that a troop, having been invested with the garment
of lawful religion, and another people with
the golden texture of a convenient doctrine, they
may become the manifestations of the lights of his
perfect power and glorious miracle, and he knew
by immediate knowledge, that such various kinds
and cameleon-like forms, by which the inscrutable
essence of his majesty can be viewed by glimpses,
<a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a><span class="pageno">317</span>
are means of possessing eternal beatitude, and obtaining
the blessings of another world, inasmuch as the
meanest of those who acquire the beauties of knowledge
having arrived from the defile of ignorance and
listlessness to the large expanse of the city of science
and knowledge, may enjoy the advantages of concord,
friendship, and society with each other.</p>

<p>In this manner, one day, when the discourse fell
upon this subject in the service of the master of
favour, the head of the sages of the age, the unequalled
jewel of the multitude of the possessors of
beneficence, the ornament of the council of experience
and of success, the splendor of the assembly of
the distinction of merit and of happiness, the man
of exalted designs, knowing the enigmas of science
and wisdom, and endowed with eminent virtues,
<span class="sc">William Bayley Saheb</span>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_273" id="fnanchor_273"></a><a href="#footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></span>
(may his prosperity be
everlasting in the ways of celebrity), I expressed my
sentiments as follows: That which embraces the different
tenets and sects, demonstrating in what respects
they are either agreeing or conflicting with
each other, is an object not destitute of difficulty
nor of pretension; but the book called <cite>Dabistán</cite>, is
incomparable for the assemblage of various tenets,
and of general and particular creeds. Direction
was therefore given that, as to execute the transcription
<a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pageno">318</span>
of such a book is, on account of the errors
which may be committed, an object of hesitation
and reflection, it should therefore be drawn in the
form of print. As obedience to the order of a lord is
praiseworthy, necessary, important, and not devoid
of various manifest advantages, therefore was printed
the beforesaid copy, which is replete with the fundamentals
of each religion and sect, and a collection
of the dogmas of all creeds and sects explicitly and
distinctively, in order to diffuse the useful notes and
disseminate the precious gems in such a manner,
that the colleagues in study may derive from the
reading of this work an abundant advantage, and a
sufficient satisfaction. Thus, a multitude of copies
in this country, which came under the view of the
editor, contained numerous errors, alterations, and
contradictions of vicious expressions; afterwards,
with extreme care and pains to obtain the authentic
copy which had come into my possession from the
town of the King of the World (<span class="place">Delhí</span>), the doubts
and faults have been, as much as possible, discarded,
and the editor carried it to a manifest correction.
Besides, on account of different idioms and technical
phrases of each sect, the understanding and interpretation
of frequent expressions of this book were
difficult without having recourse to dictionaries; on
that account, and for the convenience of those who
consider and the utility of those who investigate,
<a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a><span class="pageno">319</span>
the editor, having inquired and examined as much
as was possible, by means of the most esteemed
books, such as dictionaries, interpretations, and
commentaries of the learned of each sect, fixed the
meaning <em>of difficult words</em> at the end of this book in
some separate leaves, in such a manner that, without
trouble and useless prolixity, the brides of those
ideas may become manifest upon the exalted bridal
seats of intelligence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_274" id="fnanchor_274"></a><a href="#footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></span>
Moreover, for ranging the
vocables, the editor adopted the mode that
under the first letter should be placed the chapter,
and under the second letter the section, and he appended
this vocabulary to the end of the book. He
made also a list of errata, and concluded with an
epilogue, in order that all those who reason and
discuss upon these typical matters, may have the
facility of understanding them. Thus, from God we
expect grace and certain direction to righteousness
and to favour.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">Transcriber Note</h4>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words had not become
standardized in their spelling. Words and names have multiple spelling
variations, inconsistent hyphenation and inconsistent accent marks.
Misspelled words in English, German, Greek, Persian and Sanskrit were
left unchanged. Accent marks for transliterations of Persian and
Sanskrit were standardized with accents placed above vowels and
the letter s, and after the letter t; a high comma precedes
aspirated consonant, h.</p>

<p>Duplicate words were removed. Obvious printing errors, such as
upside down, backwards, or missing letters, and letters in the wrong
order, were corrected. Spaces were added or removed between words, as
appropriate. Quotation marks and parentheses were adjusted to standard
usage. Missing stops were added to abbreviations and ends of
sentences. Missing commas were added between items in lists. Commas
were changed to stops at ends of sentences. Asterisks were used to
indicate thought breaks. Footnotes were renumbered in sequence.
Footnote numbers within Footnote <a href="#footnote_228">[228]</a>
were changed to match referenced notes.</p>

<p>Footnotes were numbered sequentially and were moved to the end of
the section in which they occurred. Anchor for Footnote [91] is
missing in the original; it was added where it likely belonged. There
are two anchors to Footnote <a href="#footnote_183">[183]</a>. Return
link was provided to the first anchor.</p>

<p>Footnote <a href="#footnote_220">[220]</a> references an internal footnote on pages 408-409 that does not exist.
It may refer to footnote <a href="#footnote_222">[222]</a>, which is on pages 259-260.</p>

<p>On <a href="#Page_288">page 288</a>, two lines were printed in reverse order.
“… because there is lute freedom with those only who are united with
bondage with those who tend towards God, and abso- him,…” was
changed to: “…because there is bondage with those who tend towards
God, and absolute freedom with those only who are united with him,…”</p>

<p>The table of errata was formatted to display on small screens.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
